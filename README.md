# Welcome to the *Zend Framework 2* documentation

## RELEASE INFORMATION

This documentation is based on *Zend Framework 2* (master branch)


## VIEW THE DOCUMENTATION ONLINE

We used the [readthedocs.org](http://readthedocs.org/) project to render online the development version of the
documentation of Zend Framework 2.

You can read the development online documentation in 
[http://zf2.readthedocs.org](http://zf2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).

You can read the last stable documentation in 
[http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/manual/](http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/manual/).

## BUILDING DOCUMENTATION

Building the documentation requires [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/). Further requirements are _Pygments_, _docutils_ and _markupsafe_, installable with `pip install`.

Descend into the `docs/` directory, and run `make` with one of the following
targets:

- `epub` - build epub (ebook) documentation (requires
  [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) to build cross-platform epub versions)
- `help` - build Windows help files
- `html` - build HTML documentation
- `info` - build Unix info pages
- `latexpdf` - build PDF documentation (requires a working `latex` toolchain)
- `man` - build Unix manpages
- `text` - build ANSI text manual files

Examples:

```sh
make html
```

You can cleanup by running `make clean`.
