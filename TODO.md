The following is a list of documentation that needs work. Everyone is welcome to fork and edit the documentation, 
but if you plan to seriously work on a component, please drop a note to the ZF contributors mailing list
(http://framework.zend.com/archives/contributors) and/or
[the #zftalk.dev IRC channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/zftalk.dev).

Needs refactor from ZF1
-----------------------

The following documentation needs to be refactored from the ZF1 version.
Typically, this will mean updating class names to reference namespaced versions,
and potentially updating code samples to reflect any API changes.

- Dom  (Lead: Matthew Weier O'Phinney (weierophinney))
- File (Lead: Chris Martin (cgmartin))
- Json (Lead: Matthew Weier O'Phinney (weierophinney)); work begun by Robert Basic (robertbasic))
- Markup (Note that this is now in its own repository, and the API may change in
  the future)
- Navigation (Lead: Kyle Spraggs (spiffyjr))
- Paginator (Lead: Matthew Weier O'Phinney (weierophinney))
- ProgressBar (Lead: Ben Scholzen (DASPRiD))
- Serializer (Lead: Marc Bennewitz (marc-mabe))

New Components needing documentation
------------------------------------

The following are new components in need of documentation. In some cases, the
components existed previously, but have been rewritten.

- Escaper (Lead: PÃ¡draic Brady (PadraicB))
- Math (Lead: Enrico Zimuel (ezimuel))
- Session (Enrico Zimuel has begun this)
- Uri (Lead: Shahar Evron (shahar))

example section is present, but full documentation is missing.

  work begun by weierophinney)
- Crypt (Lead: Enrico Zimuel (ezimuel))

Broken documentation
--------------------

The following documentation is complete, but is incorrect due to API changes
that happened before release. You will likely need to contact somebody in IRC or
on the mailing list to determine what needs to be fixed.

- Cache (Lead: Marc Bennewitz (marc-mabe))
- Http (Lead: Dolf Schimmel (Freeaqingme)); work begun by Adam Lundrigan (adamlundrigan)
- Loader (Lead: Matthew Weier O'Phinney (weierophinney))
- ModuleManager (Lead: Evan Coury (EvanDotPro))
