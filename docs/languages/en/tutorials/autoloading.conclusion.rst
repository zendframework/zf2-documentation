总结
==========

Zend Framework encourages the use of autoloading, and even initializes it by default in ``Zend_Application``.
Hopefully this tutorial provides you with the information you need to use ``Zend\Loader\Autoloader`` to its best
advantage, as well as extend its capabilities by attaching custom autoloaders or resource autoloaders.

For more information on its usage, read the :ref:`Zend\Loader\Autoloader <zend.loader.autoloader>` and
:ref:`Zend\Loader_Autoloader\Resource <zend.loader.autoloader-resource>` manual pages.
