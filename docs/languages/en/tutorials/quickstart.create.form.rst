Create A Form
=============

For our guestbook to be useful, we need a form for submitting new entries.

Our first order of business is to create the actual form class. To create the empty form class, execute:

.. code-block:: console
   :linenos:

   % zf create form Guestbook
   Creating a form at application/forms/Guestbook.php
   Updating project profile '.zfproject.xml'

This will create the directory ``application/forms/`` with the classfile ``Guestbook.php``. Open that file and
update it so it reads as follows:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   // application/forms/Guestbook.php

   class Application_Form_Guestbook extends Zend_Form
   {
       public function init()
       {
           // Set the method for the display form to POST
           $this->setMethod('post');

           // Add an email element
           $this->addElement('text', 'email', array(
               'label'      => 'Your email address:',
               'required'   => true,
               'filters'    => array('StringTrim'),
               'validators' => array(
                   'EmailAddress',
               )
           ));

           // Add the comment element
           $this->addElement('textarea', 'comment', array(
               'label'      => 'Please Comment:',
               'required'   => true,
               'validators' => array(
                   array('validator' => 'StringLength', 'options' => array(0, 20))
                   )
           ));

           // Add a captcha
           $this->addElement('captcha', 'captcha', array(
               'label'      => 'Please enter the 5 letters displayed below:',
               'required'   => true,
               'captcha'    => array(
                   'captcha' => 'Figlet',
                   'wordLen' => 5,
                   'timeout' => 300
               )
           ));

           // Add the submit button
           $this->addElement('submit', 'submit', array(
               'ignore'   => true,
               'label'    => 'Sign Guestbook',
           ));

           // And finally add some CSRF protection
           $this->addElement('hash', 'csrf', array(
               'ignore' => true,
           ));
       }
   }

The above form defines five elements: an email address field, a comment field, a *CAPTCHA* for preventing spam
submissions, a submit button, and a *CSRF* protection token.

Next, we will add a ``signAction()`` to our ``GuestbookController`` which will process the form upon submission. To
create the action and related view script, execute the following:

.. code-block:: console
   :linenos:

   % zf create action sign Guestbook
   Creating an action named sign inside controller
       at application/controllers/GuestbookController.php
   Updating project profile '.zfproject.xml'
   Creating a view script for the sign action method
       at application/views/scripts/guestbook/sign.phtml
   Updating project profile '.zfproject.xml'

As you can see from the output, this will create a ``signAction()`` method in our controller, as well as the
appropriate view script.

Let's add some logic into our guestbook controller's sign action. We need to first check if we're getting a *POST*
or a *GET* request; in the latter case, we'll simply display the form. However, if we get a *POST* request, we'll
want to validate the posted data against our form, and, if valid, create a new entry and save it. The logic might
look like this:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   // application/controllers/GuestbookController.php

   class GuestbookController extends Zend_Controller_Action
   {
       // snipping indexAction()...

       public function signAction()
       {
           $request = $this->getRequest();
           $form    = new Application_Form_Guestbook();

           if ($this->getRequest()->isPost()) {
               if ($form->isValid($request->getPost())) {
                   $comment = new Application_Model_Guestbook($form->getValues());
                   $mapper  = new Application_Model_GuestbookMapper();
                   $mapper->save($comment);
                   return $this->_helper->redirector('index');
               }
           }

           $this->view->form = $form;
       }
   }

Of course, we also need to edit the view script; edit ``application/views/scripts/guestbook/sign.phtml`` to read:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   <!-- application/views/scripts/guestbook/sign.phtml -->

   Please use the form below to sign our guestbook!

   <?php
   $this->form->setAction($this->url());
   echo $this->form;

.. note:: Better Looking Forms

   No one will be waxing poetic about the beauty of this form anytime soon. No matter - form appearance is fully
   customizable! See the :ref:`decorators section in the reference guide <zend.form.decorators>` for details.

   Now browse to "http://localhost/guestbook/sign". You should see the following in your browser:
