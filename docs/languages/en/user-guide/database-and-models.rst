Database and models
###################

The database
------------

Now that we have the ``Album`` module set up with controller action methods and
view scripts, it is time to look at the model section of our application.
Remember that the model is the part that deals with the application’s core
purpose (the so-called “business rules”) and, in our case, deals with the
database. We will make use of the Zend Framework class
``Zend\Db\TableGateway\TableGateway`` which is used to find, insert, update and
delete rows from a database table.

We are going to use MySQL, via PHP’s PDO driver, so create a database called
``zf2tutorial``, and run these SQL statements to create the album table with some
data in it.

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE TABLE album (
      id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
      artist varchar(100) NOT NULL,
      title varchar(100) NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (id)
    );
    INSERT INTO album (artist, title)
        VALUES  ('The  Military  Wives',  'In  My  Dreams');
    INSERT INTO album (artist, title)
        VALUES  ('Adele',  '21');
    INSERT INTO album (artist, title)
        VALUES  ('Bruce  Springsteen',  'Wrecking Ball (Deluxe)');
    INSERT INTO album (artist, title)
        VALUES  ('Lana  Del  Rey',  'Born  To  Die');
    INSERT INTO album (artist, title)
        VALUES  ('Gotye',  'Making  Mirrors');

(The test data chosen happens to be the Bestsellers on Amazon UK at the time of
writing!)

We now have some data in a database and can write a very simple model for it.

The model files
---------------

Zend Framework does not provide a ``Zend\Model`` component as the model is your
business logic and it’s up to you to decide how you want it to work. There are
many components that you can use for this depending on your needs. One approach
is to have model classes represent each entity in your application and then
use mapper objects that load and save entities to the database. Another is to
use an ORM like Doctrine or Propel.

For this tutorial, we are going to create a very simple model by creating an
``AlbumTable`` class that uses the ``Zend\Db\TableGateway\TableGateway`` class
in which each album object is an ``Album`` object (known as an *entity*). This is an
implementation of the Table Data Gateway design pattern to allow for interfacing
with data in a database table. Be aware though that the Table Data Gateway
pattern can become limiting in larger systems. There is also a temptation to put
database access code into controller action methods as these are exposed by
``Zend\Db\TableGateway\AbstractTableGateway``. *Don’t do this*!

Let’s start by creating a file called ``Album.php`` under ``module/Album/src/Album/Model``:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    namespace Album\Model;

    class Album
    {
        public $id;
        public $artist;
        public $title;

        public function exchangeArray($data)
        {
            $this->id     = (isset($data['id'])) ? $data['id'] : null;
            $this->artist = (isset($data['artist'])) ? $data['artist'] : null;
            $this->title  = (isset($data['title'])) ? $data['title'] : null;
        }
    }

Our ``Album`` entity object is a simple PHP class. In order to work with
``Zend\Db``’s ``TableGateway`` class, we need to implement the ``exchangeArray()``
method. This method simply copies the data from the passed in array to our entity’s
properties. We will add an input filter for use with our form later.

But first, does the Album model we have so far work the way we expect it to? Let's write a few tests to be sure.
Create a file called ``AlbumTest.php`` under ``module/Album/test/AlbumTest/Model``:


.. code-block:: php

    namespace AlbumTest\Model;

    use Album\Model\Album;
    use PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase;

    class AlbumTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
    {
        public function testAlbumInitialState()
        {
            $album = new Album();

            $this->assertNull($album->artist, '"artist" should initially be null');
            $this->assertNull($album->id, '"id" should initially be null');
            $this->assertNull($album->title, '"title" should initially be null');
        }

        public function testExchangeArraySetsPropertiesCorrectly()
        {
            $album = new Album();
            $data  = array('artist' => 'some artist',
                           'id'     => 123,
                           'title'  => 'some title');

            $album->exchangeArray($data);

            $this->assertSame($data['artist'], $album->artist, '"artist" was not set correctly');
            $this->assertSame($data['id'], $album->id, '"id" was not set correctly');
            $this->assertSame($data['title'], $album->title, '"title" was not set correctly');
        }

        public function testExchangeArraySetsPropertiesToNullIfKeysAreNotPresent()
        {
            $album = new Album();

            $album->exchangeArray(array('artist' => 'some artist',
                                        'id'     => 123,
                                        'title'  => 'some title'));
            $album->exchangeArray(array());

            $this->assertNull($album->artist, '"artist" should have defaulted to null');
            $this->assertNull($album->id, '"id" should have defaulted to null');
            $this->assertNull($album->title, '"title" should have defaulted to null');
        }
    }

We are testing for 3 things:

1. Are all of the Album's properties initially set to NULL?
2. Will the Album's properties be set correctly when we call ``exchangeArray()``?
3. Will a default value of NULL be used for properties whose keys are not present in the ``$data`` array?

If we run ``phpunit`` again, we'll see that the answer to all three questions is "YES":

.. code-block:: text

    PHPUnit 3.5.15 by Sebastian Bergmann.

    ........

    Time: 0 seconds, Memory: 5.50Mb

    OK (7 tests, 13 assertions)

Next, we create our ``AlbumTable.php`` file in ``module/Album/src/Album/Model`` directory like this:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    namespace Album\Model;

    use Zend\Db\TableGateway\TableGateway;

    class AlbumTable
    {
        protected $tableGateway;

        public function __construct(TableGateway $tableGateway)
        {
            $this->tableGateway = $tableGateway;
        }

        public function fetchAll()
        {
            $resultSet = $this->tableGateway->select();
            return $resultSet;
        }

        public function getAlbum($id)
        {
            $id  = (int) $id;
            $rowset = $this->tableGateway->select(array('id' => $id));
            $row = $rowset->current();
            if (!$row) {
                throw new \Exception("Could not find row $id");
            }
            return $row;
        }

        public function saveAlbum(Album $album)
        {
            $data = array(
                'artist' => $album->artist,
                'title'  => $album->title,
            );

            $id = (int)$album->id;
            if ($id == 0) {
                $this->tableGateway->insert($data);
            } else {
                if ($this->getAlbum($id)) {
                    $this->tableGateway->update($data, array('id' => $id));
                } else {
                    throw new \Exception('Form id does not exist');
                }
            }
        }

        public function deleteAlbum($id)
        {
            $this->tableGateway->delete(array('id' => $id));
        }
    }


There’s a lot going on here. Firstly, we set the protected property ``$tableGateway``
to the ``TableGateway`` instance passed in the constructor. We will use this to
perform operations on the database table for our albums.

We then create some helper methods that our application will use to interface
with the table gateway.  ``fetchAll()`` retrieves all albums rows from the
database as a ``ResultSet``, ``getAlbum()`` retrieves a single row as an
``Album`` object, ``saveAlbum()`` either creates a new row in the database or
updates a row that already exists and ``deleteAlbum()`` removes the row
completely. The code for each of these methods is, hopefully, self-explanatory.

Using ServiceManager to configure the table gateway and inject into the AlbumTable
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to always use the same instance of our ``AlbumTable``, we will use the
``ServiceManager`` to define how to create one. This is most easily done in the
Module class where we create a method called ``getServiceConfig()`` which is
automatically called by the ``ModuleManager`` and applied to the ``ServiceManager``.
We’ll then be able to retrieve it in our controller when we need it.

To configure the ``ServiceManager``, we can either supply the name of the class
to be instantiated or a factory (closure or callback) that instantiates the
object when the ``ServiceManager`` needs it. We start by implementing
``getServiceConfig()`` to provide a factory that creates an ``AlbumTable``. Add
this method to the bottom of the ``Module.php`` file in ``module/Album``.

.. code-block:: php
    :emphasize-lines: 5-8,14-32

    <?php
    namespace Album;

    // Add these import statements:
    use Album\Model\Album;
    use Album\Model\AlbumTable;
    use Zend\Db\ResultSet\ResultSet;
    use Zend\Db\TableGateway\TableGateway;

    class Module
    {
        // getAutoloaderConfig() and getConfig() methods here

        // Add this method:
        public function getServiceConfig()
        {
            return array(
                'factories' => array(
                    'Album\Model\AlbumTable' =>  function($sm) {
                        $tableGateway = $sm->get('AlbumTableGateway');
                        $table = new AlbumTable($tableGateway);
                        return $table;
                    },
                    'AlbumTableGateway' => function ($sm) {
                        $dbAdapter = $sm->get('Zend\Db\Adapter\Adapter');
                        $resultSetPrototype = new ResultSet();
                        $resultSetPrototype->setArrayObjectPrototype(new Album());
                        return new TableGateway('album', $dbAdapter, null, $resultSetPrototype);
                    },
                ),
            );
        }
    }

This method returns an array of ``factories`` that are all merged together by
the ``ModuleManager`` before passing to the ``ServiceManager``. The factory
for ``Album\Model\AlbumTable`` uses the ``ServiceManager`` to create an
``AlbumTableGateway`` to pass to the ``AlbumTable``. We also tell the
``ServiceManager`` that an ``AlbumTableGateway`` is created by getting a
``Zend\Db\Adapter\Adapter`` (also from the ``ServiceManager``) and using it
to create a ``TableGateway`` object. The ``TableGateway`` is told to use an
``Album`` object whenever it creates a new result row. The TableGateway
classes use the prototype pattern for creation of result sets and entities.
This means that instead of instantiating when required, the system clones a
previously instantiated object. See
`PHP Constructor Best Practices and the Prototype Pattern <http://ralphschindler.com/2012/03/09/php-constructor-best-practices-and-the-prototype-pattern>`_
for more details.

Finally, we need to configure the ``ServiceManager`` so that it knows how to get a
``Zend\Db\Adapter\Adapter``. This is done using a factory called
``Zend\Db\Adapter\AdapterServiceFactory`` which we can configure within the
merged config system. Zend Framework 2’s ``ModuleManager`` merges all the
configuration from each module’s ``module.config.php`` file and then merges in
the files in ``config/autoload`` (``*.global.php`` and then ``*.local.php``
files). We’ll add our database configuration information to ``global.php`` which
you should commit to your version control system. You can use ``local.php``
(outside of the VCS) to store the credentials for your database if you want to.
Modify ``config/autoload/global.php`` with following code:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    return array(
        'db' => array(
            'driver'         => 'Pdo',
            'dsn'            => 'mysql:dbname=zf2tutorial;host=localhost',
            'driver_options' => array(
                PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_INIT_COMMAND => 'SET NAMES \'UTF8\''
            ),
        ),
        'service_manager' => array(
            'factories' => array(
                'Zend\Db\Adapter\Adapter'
                        => 'Zend\Db\Adapter\AdapterServiceFactory',
            ),
        ),
    );

You should put your database credentials in ``config/autoload/local.php`` so
that they are not in the git repository (as ``local.php`` is ignored):

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    return array(
        'db' => array(
            'username' => 'YOUR USERNAME HERE',
            'password' => 'YOUR PASSWORD HERE',
        ),
    );

Testing
-------

Let's write a few tests for all this code we've just written. First, we need
to create a test class for the ``AlbumTable``.
Create a file ``AlbumTableTest.php`` in ``module/Album/test/AlbumTest/Model``

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    namespace AlbumTest\Model;

    use Album\Model\AlbumTable;
    use Album\Model\Album;
    use Zend\Db\ResultSet\ResultSet;
    use PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase;

    class AlbumTableTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
    {
        public function testFetchAllReturnsAllAlbums()
        {
            $resultSet        = new ResultSet();
            $mockTableGateway = $this->getMock('Zend\Db\TableGateway\TableGateway',
                                               array('select'), array(), '', false);
            $mockTableGateway->expects($this->once())
                             ->method('select')
                             ->with()
                             ->will($this->returnValue($resultSet));

            $albumTable = new AlbumTable($mockTableGateway);

            $this->assertSame($resultSet, $albumTable->fetchAll());
        }
    }


In this test, we introduce the concept of `Mock objects
<http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.6/en/test-doubles.html#test-doubles.mock-objects>`_.
A thorough explanation of what a Mock object is goes beyond the scope of this tutorial,
but it's basically an object that takes the place of another object and behaves in
a predefined way. Since we are testing the ``AlbumTable`` here and NOT the ``TableGateway``
class (the Zend team has already tested the ``TableGateway`` class and we know it works),
we just want to make sure that our ``AlbumTable`` class is interacting with the ``TableGatway``
class the way that we expect it to. Above, we're testing to see if the ``fetchAll()`` method
of ``AlbumTable`` will call the ``select()`` method of the ``$tableGateway`` property with
no parameters. If it does, it should return a ``ResultSet`` object. Finally, we expect that
this same ``ResultSet`` object will be returned to the calling method. This test should run
fine, so now we can add the rest of the test methods:

.. code-block:: php

    public function testCanRetrieveAnAlbumByItsId()
    {
        $album = new Album();
        $album->exchangeArray(array('id'     => 123,
                                    'artist' => 'The Military Wives',
                                    'title'  => 'In My Dreams'));

        $resultSet = new ResultSet();
        $resultSet->setArrayObjectPrototype(new Album());
        $resultSet->initialize(array($album));

        $mockTableGateway = $this->getMock('Zend\Db\TableGateway\TableGateway', array('select'), array(), '', false);
        $mockTableGateway->expects($this->once())
                         ->method('select')
                         ->with(array('id' => 123))
                         ->will($this->returnValue($resultSet));

        $albumTable = new AlbumTable($mockTableGateway);

        $this->assertSame($album, $albumTable->getAlbum(123));
    }

    public function testCanDeleteAnAlbumByItsId()
    {
        $mockTableGateway = $this->getMock('Zend\Db\TableGateway\TableGateway', array('delete'), array(), '', false);
        $mockTableGateway->expects($this->once())
                         ->method('delete')
                         ->with(array('id' => 123));

        $albumTable = new AlbumTable($mockTableGateway);
        $albumTable->deleteAlbum(123);
    }

    public function testSaveAlbumWillInsertNewAlbumsIfTheyDontAlreadyHaveAnId()
    {
        $albumData = array('artist' => 'The Military Wives', 'title' => 'In My Dreams');
        $album     = new Album();
        $album->exchangeArray($albumData);

        $mockTableGateway = $this->getMock('Zend\Db\TableGateway\TableGateway', array('insert'), array(), '', false);
        $mockTableGateway->expects($this->once())
                         ->method('insert')
                         ->with($albumData);

        $albumTable = new AlbumTable($mockTableGateway);
        $albumTable->saveAlbum($album);
    }

    public function testSaveAlbumWillUpdateExistingAlbumsIfTheyAlreadyHaveAnId()
    {
        $albumData = array('id' => 123, 'artist' => 'The Military Wives', 'title' => 'In My Dreams');
        $album     = new Album();
        $album->exchangeArray($albumData);

        $resultSet = new ResultSet();
        $resultSet->setArrayObjectPrototype(new Album());
        $resultSet->initialize(array($album));

        $mockTableGateway = $this->getMock('Zend\Db\TableGateway\TableGateway',
                                           array('select', 'update'), array(), '', false);
        $mockTableGateway->expects($this->once())
                         ->method('select')
                         ->with(array('id' => 123))
                         ->will($this->returnValue($resultSet));
        $mockTableGateway->expects($this->once())
                         ->method('update')
                         ->with(array('artist' => 'The Military Wives', 'title' => 'In My Dreams'),
                                array('id' => 123));

        $albumTable = new AlbumTable($mockTableGateway);
        $albumTable->saveAlbum($album);
    }

    public function testExceptionIsThrownWhenGettingNonexistentAlbum()
    {
        $resultSet = new ResultSet();
        $resultSet->setArrayObjectPrototype(new Album());
        $resultSet->initialize(array());

        $mockTableGateway = $this->getMock('Zend\Db\TableGateway\TableGateway', array('select'), array(), '', false);
        $mockTableGateway->expects($this->once())
                         ->method('select')
                         ->with(array('id' => 123))
                         ->will($this->returnValue($resultSet));

        $albumTable = new AlbumTable($mockTableGateway);

        try
        {
            $albumTable->getAlbum(123);
        }
        catch (\Exception $e)
        {
            $this->assertSame('Could not find row 123', $e->getMessage());
            return;
        }

        $this->fail('Expected exception was not thrown');
    }

Let's review our tests. We are testing that:

1. We can retrieve an individual album by its ID.
2. We can delete albums.
3. We can save new album.
4. We can update existing albums.
5. We will encounter an exception if we're trying to retrieve an album that doesn't exist.

Great - our ``AlbumTable`` class is tested. Let's move on!

Back to the controller
----------------------

Now that the ``ServiceManager`` can create an ``AlbumTable`` instance for us, we
can add a method to the controller to retrieve it. Add ``getAlbumTable()`` to
the ``AlbumController`` class:

.. code-block:: php

    // module/Album/src/Album/Controller/AlbumController.php:
        public function getAlbumTable()
        {
            if (!$this->albumTable) {
                $sm = $this->getServiceLocator();
                $this->albumTable = $sm->get('Album\Model\AlbumTable');
            }
            return $this->albumTable;
        }

You should also add:

.. code-block:: php

    protected $albumTable;

to the top of the class.

We can now call ``getAlbumTable()`` from within our controller whenever we need
to interact with our model. Let's make sure it works by writing a test.

Add this test to your ``AlbumControllerTest`` class:

.. code-block:: php

    public function testGetAlbumTableReturnsAnInstanceOfAlbumTable()
    {
        $this->assertInstanceOf('Album\Model\AlbumTable', $this->controller->getAlbumTable());
    }

If the service locator was configured correctly in ``Module.php``, then we
should get an instance of ``Album\Model\AlbumTable`` when calling ``getAlbumTable()``.

Listing albums
--------------

In order to list the albums, we need to retrieve them from the model and pass
them to the view. To do this, we fill in ``indexAction()`` within
``AlbumController``.  Update the ``AlbumController``’s ``indexAction()`` like
this:

.. code-block:: php

    // module/Album/src/Album/Controller/AlbumController.php:
    // ...
        public function indexAction()
        {
            return new ViewModel(array(
                'albums' => $this->getAlbumTable()->fetchAll(),
            ));
        }
    // ...

With Zend Framework 2, in order to set variables in the view, we return a
``ViewModel`` instance where the first parameter of the constructor is an array
from the action containing data we need. These are then automatically passed to
the view script. The ``ViewModel`` object also allows us to change the view
script that is used, but the default is to use ``{controller name}/{action
name}``. We can now fill in the ``index.phtml`` view script:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    // module/Album/view/album/album/index.phtml:

    $title = 'My albums';
    $this->headTitle($title);
    ?>
    <h1><?php echo $this->escapeHtml($title); ?></h1>
    <p>
        <a href="<?php echo $this->url('album', array('action'=>'add'));?>">Add new album</a>
    </p>

    <table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th>Title</th>
        <th>Artist</th>
        <th>&nbsp;</th>
    </tr>
    <?php foreach ($albums as $album) : ?>
    <tr>
        <td><?php echo $this->escapeHtml($album->title);?></td>
        <td><?php echo $this->escapeHtml($album->artist);?></td>
        <td>
            <a href="<?php echo $this->url('album',
                array('action'=>'edit', 'id' => $album->id));?>">Edit</a>
            <a href="<?php echo $this->url('album',
                array('action'=>'delete', 'id' => $album->id));?>">Delete</a>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <?php endforeach; ?>
    </table>

The first thing we do is to set the title for the page (used in the layout) and
also set the title for the ``<head>`` section using the ``headTitle()`` view
helper which will display in the browser’s title bar. We then create a link to
add a new album.

The ``url()`` view helper is provided by Zend Framework 2 and is used to create
the links we need. The first parameter to ``url()`` is the route name we wish to use
for construction of the URL, and the second parameter is an array of all the
variables to fit into the placeholders to use. In this case we use our ‘album’
route which is set up to accept two placeholder variables: ``action`` and ``id``.

We iterate over the ``$albums`` that we assigned from the controller action. The
Zend Framework 2 view system automatically ensures that these variables are
extracted into the scope of the view script, so that we don’t have to worry
about prefixing them with ``$this->`` as we used to have to do with Zend
Framework 1; however you can do so if you wish.

We then create a table to display each album’s title and artist, and provide
links to allow for editing and deleting the record. A standard ``foreach:`` loop
is used to iterate over the list of albums, and we use the alternate form using
a colon and ``endforeach;`` as it is easier to scan than to try and match up
braces. Again, the ``url()`` view helper is used to create the edit and delete
links.

.. note::

    We always use the ``escapeHtml()`` view helper to help protect
    ourselves from XSS vulnerabilities.
