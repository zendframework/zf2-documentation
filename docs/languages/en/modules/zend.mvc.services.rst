Default Services
================

The default and recommended way to write Zend Framework applications uses a set of services defined in the
``Zend\Mvc\Service`` namespace. This chapter details what each of those services are, the classes they represent,
and the configuration options available.

.. _zend.mvc.services.intro:

Theory of Operation
-------------------

To allow easy configuration of all the different parts of the `MVC` system, a somewhat complex set of services and
their factories has been created. We'll try to give a simplified explanation of the proccess. 

When a ``Zend\Mvc\Application`` is created, a ``Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceManager`` object is created and configured
via ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ServiceManagerConfig``. The ``ServiceManagerConfig`` gets the configuration from
``application.config.php`` (or some other `application` configuration you passed to the ``Application`` when creating
it). From all the service and factories provided in the ``Zend\Mvc\Service`` namespace, ``ServiceManagerConfig`` is
responsible of configuring only three: ``SharedEventManager``, ``EventManager``, and ``ModuleManager``.

After this, the ``Application`` calls for the ``ModuleManager``. At this point, the ``ModuleManager`` further
configures the ``ServiceManager`` with services and factories provided in ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ServiceLocator``.
This approach allows to keep the main application configuration as simple as possible, and to give the developer
the power to configure different parts of the `MVC` system from within the modules, overriding any default
configuration in these `MVC` services.

.. _zend.mvc.services.service-manager-configuration:

ServiceManager
--------------

This is the one service class referenced directly in the application bootstrapping. It provides the following:

- **Invokable services**

  - ``DispatchListener``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\DispatchListener``.

  - ``RouteListener``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\RouteListener``.

- **Factories**

  - ``Application``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ApplicationFactory``.

  - ``Config``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ConfigFactory``. Internally, this pulls the
    ``ModuleManager`` service, and calls its ``loadModules()`` method, and retrieves the merged configuration from
    the module event. As such, this service contains the entire, merged application configuration.

  - ``ControllerLoader``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ControllerLoaderFactory``. This scoped container will be
    populated by the ``ServiceListener``.

    Additionally, the scoped container is configured to use the ``Di`` service as an abstract service factory --
    effectively allowing you to fall back to DI in order to retrieve your controllers.
    If you want to use ``Zend\Di`` to retrieve your controllers, you must white-list them in your DI configuration
    under the ``allowed_controllers`` key (otherwise, they will just be ignored).

    If the controller implements the ``Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceLocatorAwareInterface`` interface, an instance
    of the ``ServiceManager`` will be injected into it.

    If the controller implements the ``Zend\EventManager\EventManagerAwareInterface`` interface, an instance of
    the ``EventManager`` will be injected into it.

    Finally, an initializer will inject it with the ``ControllerPluginManager`` service, as long as the
    ``setPluginManager`` is implemented.

  - ``ControllerPluginManager``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ControllerPluginManagerFactory``. This instantiates
    the ``Zend\Mvc\Controller\PluginManager`` instance, passing it the service manager instance. It also uses the
    ``Di`` service as an abstract service factory -- effectively allowing you to fall back to DI in order to retrieve
    your controller plugins.

    It registers a set of default controller plugins, and contains an initializer for injecting plugins
    with the current controller.

  - ``DependencyInjector``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\DiFactory``. This pulls the ``Config`` service,
    and looks for a "di" key; if found, that value is used to configure a new ``Zend\Di\Di`` instance.
    Additionally, the ``Di`` instance is used to seed a ``Zend\ServiceManager\Di\DiAbstractServiceFactory``
    instance which is then attached to the service manager as an abstract factory -- effectively enabling DI as a
    fallback for providing services.

  - ``EventManager``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\EventManagerFactory``. This factory composes a static reference
    to a ``SharedEventManager``, which is injected in a new ``EventManager`` instance. This service is not shared
    by default, allowing the ability to have an ``EventManager`` per service, with a shared ``SharedEventManager``
    injected in each.

  - ``ModuleManager``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ModuleManagerFactory``.

    This is perhaps the most complex factory in the MVC stack. It expects that an ``ApplicationConfig``
    service has been injected, with keys for ``module_listener_options`` and ``modules``; see the quick start for
    samples.

    It instantiates an instance of ``Zend\ModuleManager\Listener\DefaultListenerAggregate``, using the
    "module_listener_options" retrieved. Checks if a service with the name ``ServiceListener`` exists, otherwise
    falls back to the ``ServiceListenerFactory``, and instantiates it. A bunch of service listerns will be added
    to the ``ServiceListener``, like listeners for the ``getServiceConfig``, ``getControllerConfig``,
    ``getControllerPluginConfig``, ``getViewHelperConfig`` module methods.

    Next, it retrieves the ``EventManager`` service, and attaches the above listeners.

    It instantiates a ``Zend\ModuleManager\ModuleEvent`` instance, setting the "ServiceManager" parameter to the
    service manager object.

    Finally, it instantiates a ``Zend\ModuleManager\ModuleManager`` instance, and injects the ``EventManager`` and
    ``ModuleEvent``.

  - ``ServiceListenerFactory``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ServiceListenerFactory``. The factory is used to
    instantiate the ``ServiceListener``, while allowing easy extending. It checks if a service with the name
    ``ServiceListenerInterface`` exists, which must implement ``Zend\ModuleManager\Listener\ServiceListenerInterface``,
    before instantiating the default ``ServiceListener``.

    In addition to this, it retrieves the ``ApplicationConfig`` and looks for the ``service_listener_options`` key.
    This allows you to register own listerns for module methods and configuration keys to create an own service
    manager; see the application configuration options for samples.

  - ``Request``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\RequestFactory``. The factory is used to create and return a
    request instance, according to the current environment. If the current environment is ``cli``, it will
    create a ``Zend\Console\Request``, or a ``Zend\Http\PhpEnvironment\Request`` if the current environment is
    `HTTP`.

  - ``Response``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ResponseFactory``. The factory is used to create and return a
    response instance, according to the current environment. If the current environment is ``cli``, it will
    create a ``Zend\Console\Response``, or a ``Zend\Http\PhpEnvironment\Response`` if the current environment is
    `HTTP`.

  - ``Router``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\RouterFactory``. This grabs the ``Config`` service, and pulls
    from the ``router`` key, passing it to ``Zend\Mvc\Router\Http\TreeRouteStack::factory`` in order to get a
    configured router instance.

  - ``ViewManager``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ViewManagerFactory``. The factory is used to create and return
    a view manager, according to the current environment.  If the current environment is ``cli``, it will
    create a ``Zend\Mvc\View\Console\ViewManager``, or a ``Zend\Mvc\View\Http\ViewManager`` if the current
    environment is `HTTP`.

  - ``ViewResolver``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ViewResolverFactory``, which creates and returns the aggregate
    view resolver. It also attaches the ``ViewTemplateMapResolver`` and ``ViewTemplatePathStack`` services to it.

  - ``ViewTemplateMapResolver``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ViewTemplateMapResolverFactory`` which creates,
    configures and returns the ``Zend\View\Resolver\TemplateMapResolver``.

  - ``ViewTemplatePathStack``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ViewTemplatePathStackFactory`` which creates,
    configures and returns the ``Zend\View\Resolver\TemplatePathStack``.

  - ``ViewHelperManager``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ViewHelperManagerFactory``, which creates, configures
    and returns the view helper manager.

  - ``ViewFeedRenderer``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ViewFeedRendererFactory``, which simply returns a
    ``Zend\View\Renderer\FeedRenderer`` instance.

  - ``ViewFeedStrategy``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ViewFeedStrategyFactory``. This instantiates a
    ``Zend\View\Strategy\FeedStrategy`` instance with the ``ViewFeedRenderer`` service.

  - ``ViewJsonRenderer``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ViewJsonRendererFactory``, which simply returns a
    ``Zend\View\Renderer\JsonRenderer`` instance.

  - ``ViewJsonStrategy``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ViewJsonStrategyFactory``. This instantiates a
    ``Zend\View\Strategy\JsonStrategy`` instance with the ``ViewJsonRenderer`` service.

- **Aliases**

  - ``Config``, mapping to the ``Config`` service.

  - ``Di``, mapping to the ``DependencyInjector`` service.

  - ``Zend\EventManager\EventManagerInterface``, mapping to the ``EventManager`` service. This is mainly to ensure
    that when falling through to DI, classes are still injected via the ``ServiceManager``.

  - ``Zend\Mvc\Controller\PluginBroker``, mapping to the ``ControllerPluginBroker`` service. This is mainly to
    ensure that when falling through to DI, classes are still injected via the ``ServiceManager``.

  - ``Zend\Mvc\Controller\PluginLoader``, mapping to the ``ControllerPluginLoader`` service. This is mainly to
    ensure that when falling through to DI, classes are still injected via the ``ServiceManager``.

Additionally, two initializers are registered. Initializers are run on created instances, and may be used to
further configure them. The two initializers the ``ServiceManagerConfig`` class creates and registers do the
following:

- For objects that implement ``Zend\EventManager\EventManagerAwareInterface``, the ``EventManager`` service will be
  retrieved and injected. This service is **not** shared, though each instance it creates is injected with a shared
  instance of ``SharedEventManager``.

- For objects that implement ``Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceLocatorAwareInterface``, the ``ServiceManager`` will
  inject itself into the object.

Finally, the ``ServiceManager`` registers itself as the ``ServiceManager`` service, and aliases itself to the class
names ``Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceManagerInterface`` and ``Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceManager``.

.. _zend.mvc.services.view-manager:

ViewManager
-----------

The View layer within ``Zend\Mvc`` consists of a large number of collaborators and event listeners. As such,
``Zend\Mvc\View\ViewManager`` was created to handle creation of the various objects, as well as wiring them
together and establishing event listeners.

The ``ViewManager`` itself is an event listener on the ``bootstrap`` event. It retrieves the ``ServiceManager``
from the ``Application`` object, as well as its composed ``EventManager``.

Configuration for all members of the ``ViewManager`` fall under the ``view_manager`` configuration key, and expect
values as noted below. The following services are created and managed by the ``ViewManager``:

- ``ViewHelperManager``, representing and aliased to ``Zend\View\HelperPluginManager``. It is seeded with the
  ``ServiceManager``. Created via the ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ViewHelperManagerFactory``.

  - The ``Router`` service is retrieved, and injected into the ``Url`` helper.

  - If the ``base_path`` key is present, it is used to inject the ``BasePath`` view helper; otherwise, the
    ``Request`` service is retrieved, and the value of its ``getBasePath()`` method is used.

  - If the ``doctype`` key is present, it will be used to set the value of the ``Doctype`` view helper.

- ``ViewTemplateMapResolver``, representing and aliased to ``Zend\View\Resolver\TemplateMapResolver``. If a
  ``template_map`` key is present, it will be used to seed the template map.

- ``ViewTemplatePathStack``, representing and aliased to ``Zend\View\Resolver\TemplatePathStack``. If a
  ``template_path_stack`` key is prsent, it will be used to seed the stack.

- ``ViewResolver``, representing and aliased to ``Zend\View\Resolver\AggregateResolver`` and
  ``Zend\View\Resolver\ResolverInterface``. It is seeded with the ``ViewTemplateMapResolver`` and
  ``ViewTemplatePathStack`` services as resolvers.

- ``ViewRenderer``, representing and aliased to ``Zend\View\Renderer\PhpRenderer`` and
  ``Zend\View\Renderer\RendererInterface``. It is seeded with the ``ViewResolver`` and ``ViewHelperBroker``
  services. Additionally, the ``ViewModel`` helper gets seeded with the ``ViewModel`` as its root (layout) model.

- ``ViewPhpRendererStrategy``, representing and aliased to ``Zend\View\Strategy\PhpRendererStrategy``. It gets
  seeded with the ``ViewRenderer`` service.

- ``View``, representing and aliased to ``Zend\View\View``. It gets seeded with the ``EventManager`` service, and
  attaches the ``ViewPhpRendererStrategy`` as an aggregate listener.

- ``DefaultRenderingStrategy``, representing and aliased to ``Zend\Mvc\View\DefaultRenderingStrategy``. If the
  ``layout`` key is present, it is used to seed the strategy's layout template. It is seeded with the ``View``
  service.

- ``ExceptionStrategy``, representing and aliased to ``Zend\Mvc\View\ExceptionStrategy``. If the
  ``display_exceptions`` or ``exception_template`` keys are present, they are used to configure the strategy.

- ``RouteNotFoundStrategy``, representing and aliased to ``Zend\Mvc\View\RouteNotFoundStrategy`` and
  ``404Stategy``. If the ``display_not_found_reason`` or ``not_found_template`` keys are present, they are used to
  configure the strategy.

- ``ViewModel``. In this case, no service is registered; the ``ViewModel`` is simply retrieved from the
  ``MvcEvent`` and injected with the layout template name.

The ``ViewManager`` also creates several other listeners, but does not expose them as services; these include
``Zend\Mvc\View\CreateViewModelListener``, ``Zend\Mvc\View\InjectTemplateListener``, and
``Zend\Mvc\View\InjectViewModelListener``. These, along with ``RouteNotFoundStrategy``, ``ExceptionStrategy``, and
``DefaultRenderingStrategy`` are attached as listeners either to the application ``EventManager`` instance or the
``SharedEventManager`` instance.

Finally, if you have a ``strategies`` key in your configuration, the ``ViewManager`` will loop over these and
attach them in order to the ``View`` service as listeners, at a priority of 100 (allowing them to execute before
the ``DefaultRenderingStrategy``).

Application Configuration Options
---------------------------------

The following options may be used to provide initial configuration for the ``ServiceManager``, ``ModuleManager``,
and ``Application`` instances, allowing them to then find and aggregate the configuration used for the
``Config`` service, which is intended for configuring all other objects in the system. These configuration
directives go to the ``config/application.config.php`` file.

   );

.. _zend.mvc.services.config:

Default Configuration Options
-----------------------------

The following options are available when using the default services configured by the ``ServiceManagerConfig``
and ``ViewManager``. 

These configuration directives can go to the ``config/autoload/{,*.}{global,local}.php`` files, or in the
``module/<module name>/config/module.config.php`` configuration files. The merging of these configuration
files is done by the ``ModuleManager``. It first merges each module's ``module.config.php`` file, and then
the files in ``config/autoload`` (first the ``*.global.php`` and then the ``*.local.php`` files). The order
of the merge is relevant so you can override a module's configuration with your application configuration. 
If you have both a ``config/autoload/my.global.config.php`` and ``config/autoload/my.local.config.php``, the
local configuration file overrides the global configuration.

.. warning::

    Local configuration files are intended to keep sensitive information, such as database credentials, and as
    such, it is highly recommended to keep these local configuration files out of your VCS. The 
    ``ZendSkeletonApplication``\'s ``config/autoload/.gitignore`` file ignores ``*.local.php`` files by default.
