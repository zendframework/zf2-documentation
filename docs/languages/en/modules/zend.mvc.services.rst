Default Services
================

The default and recommended way to write Zend Framework applications uses a set of services defined
in the ``Zend\Mvc\Service`` namespace. This chapter details what each of those services are, the
classes they represent, and the configuration options available.

Many of the services are provided by other components, and the factories and abstract factories
themselves are defined in the individual components. We will cover those factories in this chapter,
however, as usage is generally the same between each.

.. _zend.mvc.services.intro:

Theory of Operation
-------------------

To allow easy configuration of all the different parts of the `MVC` system, a somewhat complex set
of services and their factories has been created. We'll try to give a simplified explanation of the
process.

When a ``Zend\Mvc\Application`` is created, a ``Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceManager`` object is
created and configured via ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ServiceManagerConfig``. The ``ServiceManagerConfig``
gets the configuration from ``application.config.php`` (or some other `application` configuration
you passed to the ``Application`` when creating it). From all the service and factories provided in
the ``Zend\Mvc\Service`` namespace, ``ServiceManagerConfig`` is responsible of configuring only
three: ``SharedEventManager``, ``EventManager``, and ``ModuleManager``.

After this, the ``Application`` calls for the ``ModuleManager``. At this point, the
``ModuleManager`` further configures the ``ServiceManager`` with services and factories provided in
``Zend\Mvc\Service\ServiceListenerFactory``.  This approach allows us to keep the main application
configuration concise, and to give the developer the power to configure different parts of the `MVC`
system from within the modules, overriding any default configuration in these `MVC` services.

.. _zend.mvc.services.service-manager-configuration:

ServiceManager
--------------

As a quick review, the following service types may be configured:

- **Invokable services**, which map a service name to a class that has no constructor or a
  constructor that accepts no arguments.

- **Factories**, which map a service name to a factory which will create and return an object. A
  factory receives the service manager as an argument, and may be any PHP callable, or a class or
  object that implements ``Zend\ServiceManager\FactoryInterface``.

- **Abstract factories**, which are factories that can create any number of named services that
  share the same instantiation pattern; examples include database adapters, cache adapters, loggers,
  etc. The factory receives the service manager as an argument, the resolved service name, and the
  requested service name; it **must** be a class or object implementing
  ``Zend\ServiceManager\AbstractFactoryInterface``. See the :ref:`section on abstract factories
  <zend.mvc.services.abstract-factories>` for configuration information.

- **Aliases**, which alias one service name to another. Aliases can also reference other aliases.

- **Initializers**, which receive the newly created instance and the service manager, and which can
  be used to perform additional initialization tasks. The most common use case is to test the
  instance against specific "Aware" interfaces, and, if matching, inject them with the appropriate
  service.

- **Plugin managers**, which are specialized service managers used to manage objects that are of a
  related type, such as view helpers, controller plugins, controllers, etc. Plugin managers accept
  configuration just like service managers, and as such can compose invokable services, factories,
  abstract factories, aliases, and initializers. They are also ``ServiceLocatorAware``, and will be
  injected with the application service manager instance, giving factories and abstract factories
  access to application-level services when needed. See the heading :ref:`Plugin managers
  <zend.mvc.services.plugin-managers>` for a list of available plugin managers.

The application service manager is referenced directly during bootstrapping, and has the following
services configured out of the box.

- **Invokable services**

  - ``DispatchListener``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\DispatchListener``.

  - ``RouteListener``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\RouteListener``.

  - ``SendResponseListener``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\SendResponseListener``.

  - ``SharedEventManager``, mapping to ``Zend\EventManager\SharedEventManager``.

- **Factories**

  - ``Application``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ApplicationFactory``.

  - ``Config``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ConfigFactory``. Internally, this pulls the
    ``ModuleManager`` service, and calls its ``loadModules()`` method, and retrieves the merged
    configuration from the module event. As such, this service contains the entire, merged
    application configuration.

  - ``ControllerManager``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ControllerLoaderFactory``. This creates an
    instance of ``Zend\Mvc\Controller\ControllerManager``, passing the service manager instance.

    Additionally, it uses the ``DiStrictAbstractServiceFactory`` service -- effectively allowing you
    to fall back to DI in order to retrieve your controllers. If you want to use ``Zend\Di`` to
    retrieve your controllers, you must white-list them in your DI configuration under the
    ``allowed_controllers`` key (otherwise, they will just be ignored).

    The ``ControllerManager`` will add an initializer that will do the following:

      - If the controller implements the ``Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceLocatorAwareInterface``
        interface, an instance of the ``ServiceManager`` will be injected into it.

      - If the controller implements the ``Zend\EventManager\EventManagerAwareInterface`` interface,
        an instance of the ``EventManager`` will be injected into it.

      - Finally, an initializer will inject it with the ``ControllerPluginManager`` service, as long
        as the ``setPluginManager`` method is implemented.

  - ``ControllerPluginManager``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ControllerPluginManagerFactory``.
    This instantiates the ``Zend\Mvc\Controller\PluginManager`` instance, passing it the service
    manager instance. It also uses the ``DiAbstractServiceFactory`` service -- effectively allowing
    you to fall back to DI in order to retrieve your :ref:`controller plugins
    <zend.mvc.controller-plugins>`.

    It registers a set of default controller plugins, and contains an initializer for injecting
    plugins with the current controller.

  - ``ConsoleAdapter``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ConsoleAdapterFactory``. This grabs the
    ``Config`` service, pulls from the ``console`` key, and do the following:

    - If the ``adapter`` subkey is present, it is used to get the adapter instance, otherwise,
      ``Zend\Console\Console::detectBestAdapter()`` will be called to configure an adapter instance.

    - If the ``charset`` subkey is present, the is used to set the adapter charset.

  - ``ConsoleRouter``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\RouterFactory``. This grabs the ``Config``
    service, and pulls from the ``console`` key and ``router`` subkey, configuring a
    ``Zend\Mvc\Router\Console\SimpleRouteStack`` instance.

  - ``ConsoleViewManager``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ConsoleViewManagerFactory``. This creates
    and returns an instance of ``Zend\Mvc\View\Console\ViewManager``, which in turn registers and
    initializes a number of console-specific view services.

  - ``DependencyInjector``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\DiFactory``. This pulls the ``Config``
    service, and looks for a "di" key; if found, that value is used to configure a new
    ``Zend\Di\Di`` instance.

  - ``DiAbstractServiceFactory``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\DiAbstractServiceFactoryFactory``.
    This creates an instance of ``Zend\ServiceManager\Di\DiAbstractServiceFactory`` injecting the
    ``Di`` service instance. That instance is attached to the service manager as an abstract factory
    -- effectively enabling DI as a fallback for providing services.

  - ``DiServiceInitializer``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\DiServiceInitializerFactory``. This
    creates an instance of ``Zend\ServiceManager\Di\DiServiceInitializer`` injecting the ``Di``
    service and the service manager itself.

  - ``DiStrictAbstractServiceFactory``, mapping to
    ``Zend\Mvc\Service\DiStrictAbstractServiceFactoryFactory``. This creates an instance of
    ``Zend\Mvc\Service\DiStrictAbstractServiceFactoryFactory`` injecting the ``Di`` service
    instance.

  - ``EventManager``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\EventManagerFactory``. This factory returns a
    new instance of ``Zend\EventManager\EventManager`` on each request.  This service is not shared
    by default, allowing the ability to have an ``EventManager`` per service, with a shared
    ``SharedEventManager`` injected in each.

  - ``FilterManager``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\FilterManagerFactory``. This instantiates the
    ``Zend\Filter\FilterPluginManager`` instance, passing it the service manager instance -- this is
    used to manage filters for the :ref:`filter chains <zend.filter.filter_chains>`. It also uses
    the ``DiAbstractServiceFactory`` service -- effectively allowing you to fall back to DI in order
    to retrieve filters.

  - ``FormElementManager``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\FormElementManagerFactory``. This
    instantiates the ``Zend\Form\FormElementManager`` instance, passing it the service manager
    instance -- this is used to manage :ref:`form elements <zend.form.elements.intro>`. It also uses
    the ``DiAbstractServiceFactory`` service -- effectively allowing you to fall back to DI in order
    to retrieve form elements.

  - ``HttpRouter``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\RouterFactory``. This grabs the ``Config``
    service, and pulls from the ``router`` key, configuring a
    ``Zend\Mvc\Router\Http\TreeRouteStack`` instance.

  - ``HttpViewManager``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\HttpViewManagerFactory``. This creates
    and returns an instance of ``Zend\Mvc\View\Http\ViewManager``, which in turn registers and
    initializes a number of HTTP-specific view services.

  - ``HydratorManager``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\HydratorManagerFactory``. This creates
    and returns an instance of ``Zend\Stdlib\Hydrator\HydratorPluginManager``, which can be used to
    manage and persist hydrator instances.

  - ``InputFilterManager``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\InputFilterManagerFactory``. This creates
    and returns an instance of ``Zend\InputFilter\InputFilterPluginManager``, which can be used to
    manage and persist input filter instances.

  - ``ModuleManager``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ModuleManagerFactory``.

    This is perhaps the most complex factory in the MVC stack. It expects that an
    ``ApplicationConfig`` service has been injected, with keys for ``module_listener_options`` and
    ``modules``; see the quick start for samples.

    It instantiates an instance of ``Zend\ModuleManager\Listener\DefaultListenerAggregate``, using
    the "module_listener_options" retrieved. Checks if a service with the name ``ServiceListener``
    exists, otherwise it sets a factory with that name mapping to
    ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ServiceListenerFactory``. A bunch of service listeners will be added to the
    ``ServiceListener``, like listeners for the ``getServiceConfig``, ``getControllerConfig``,
    ``getControllerPluginConfig``, ``getViewHelperConfig`` module methods.

    Next, it retrieves the ``EventManager`` service, and attaches the above listeners.

    It instantiates a ``Zend\ModuleManager\ModuleEvent`` instance, setting the "ServiceManager"
    parameter to the service manager object.

    Finally, it instantiates a ``Zend\ModuleManager\ModuleManager`` instance, and injects the
    ``EventManager`` and ``ModuleEvent``.

  - ``MvcTranslator``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\TranslatorServiceFactory``, and returning an
    instance of ``Zend\Mvc\I18n\Translator``, which extends ``Zend\I18n\Translator\Translator`` and
    implements ``Zend\Validator\Translator\TranslatorInterface``, allowing the instance to be used
    anywhere a translator may be required in the framework.

  - ``PaginatorPluginManager``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\PaginatorPluginManagerFactory``. This
    instantiates the ``Zend\Paginator\AdapterPluginManager`` instance, passing it the service
    manager instance -- this is used to manage :ref:`paginator adapters
    <zend.paginator.usage.paginating.adapters>`. It also uses the ``DiAbstractServiceFactory``
    service -- effectively allowing you to fall back to DI in order to retrieve paginator adapters.

  - ``Request``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\RequestFactory``. The factory is used to create and
    return a request instance, according to the current environment. If the current environment is
    ``cli``, it will create a ``Zend\Console\Request``, or a ``Zend\Http\PhpEnvironment\Request`` if
    the current environment is `HTTP`.

  - ``Response``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ResponseFactory``. The factory is used to create and
    return a response instance, according to the current environment. If the current environment is
    ``cli``, it will create a ``Zend\Console\Response``, or a ``Zend\Http\PhpEnvironment\Response``
    if the current environment is `HTTP`.

  - ``Router``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\RouterFactory``. If in a console enviroment, this will
    behave the same way as the ``ConsoleRouter`` service, if not, it will behave the same way as
    ``HttpRouter`` service.

  - ``RoutePluginManager``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\RoutePluginManagerFactory``. This
    instantiates the ``Zend\Mvc\Router\RoutePluginManager`` instance, passing it the service manager
    instance -- this is used to manage :ref:`route types <zend.mvc.routing.http-route-types>`. It
    also uses the ``DiAbstractServiceFactory`` service -- effectively allowing you to fall back to
    DI in order to retrieve route types.

  - ``SerializerAdapterManager``, mapping to
    ``Zend\Mvc\Service\SerializerAdapterPluginManagerFactory``, which returns an instance of
    ``Zend\Serializer\AdapterPluginManager``. This is a plugin manager for managing serializer
    adapter instances.

  - ``ServiceListener``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ServiceListenerFactory``. The factory is used
    to instantiate the ``ServiceListener``, while allowing easy extending. It checks if a service
    with the name ``ServiceListenerInterface`` exists, which must implement
    ``Zend\ModuleManager\Listener\ServiceListenerInterface``, before instantiating the default
    ``ServiceListener``.

    In addition to this, it retrieves the ``ApplicationConfig`` and looks for the
    ``service_listener_options`` key.  This allows you to register own listeners for module methods
    and configuration keys to create an own service manager; see the :ref:`application configuration
    options <zend.mvc.services.app-config>` for samples.

  - ``ValidatorManager``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ValidatorManagerFactory``. This instantiates
    the ``Zend\Validator\ValidatorPluginManager`` instance, passing it the service manager instance
    -- this is used to manage :ref:`validators <zend.validator.set>`. It also uses the
    ``DiAbstractServiceFactory`` service -- effectively allowing you to fall back to DI in order to
    retrieve validators.

  - ``ViewFeedRenderer``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ViewFeedRendererFactory``, which returns
    an instance of ``Zend\View\Renderer\FeedRenderer``, used to render feeds.

  - ``ViewFeedStrategy``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ViewFeedStrategyFactory``, which returns
    an instance of ``Zend\View\Strategy\FeedStrategy``, used to select the ``ViewFeedRenderer``
    given the appropriate criteria.

  - ``ViewHelperManager``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ViewHelperManagerFactory``, which returns
    an instance of ``Zend\View\HelperManager``. This is a plugin manager for managing view helper
    instances.

  - ``ViewJsonRenderer``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ViewJsonRendererFactory``, which returns
    an instance of ``Zend\View\Renderer\JsonRenderer``, used to render JSON structures.

  - ``ViewJsonStrategy``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ViewJsonStrategyFactory``, which returns
    an instance of ``Zend\View\Strategy\JsonStrategy``, used to select the ``ViewJsonRenderer``
    given the appropriate criteria.

  - ``ViewManager``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ViewManagerFactory``. The factory is used to
    create and return a view manager, according to the current environment.  If the current
    environment is ``cli``, it will create a ``Zend\Mvc\View\Console\ViewManager``, or a
    ``Zend\Mvc\View\Http\ViewManager`` if the current environment is `HTTP`.

  - ``ViewResolver``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ViewResolverFactory``, which creates and returns
    the aggregate view resolver. It also attaches the ``ViewTemplateMapResolver`` and
    ``ViewTemplatePathStack`` services to it.

  - ``ViewTemplateMapResolver``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ViewTemplateMapResolverFactory``
    which creates, configures and returns the ``Zend\View\Resolver\TemplateMapResolver``.

  - ``ViewTemplatePathStack``, mapping to ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ViewTemplatePathStackFactory`` which
    creates, configures and returns the ``Zend\View\Resolver\TemplatePathStack``.

- **Abstract factories**

  - ``Zend\Cache\Service\StorageCacheAbstractServiceFactory`` (opt-in; registered by default in the
    skeleton application).

  - ``Zend\Db\Adapter\AdapterAbstractServiceFactory`` (opt-in).

  - ``Zend\Form\FormAbstractServiceFactory`` is registered by default. 

  - ``Zend\Log\LoggerAbstractServiceFactory`` (opt-in; registered by default in the skeleton
    application). 

- **Aliases**

  - ``Configuration``, mapping to the ``Config`` service.

  - ``Console``, mapping to the ``ConsoleAdapter`` service.

  - ``Di``, mapping to the ``DependencyInjector`` service.

  - ``Zend\Di\LocatorInterface``, mapping to the ``DependencyInjector`` service.

  - ``Zend\EventManager\EventManagerInterface``, mapping to the ``EventManager`` service. This is mainly to ensure
    that when falling through to DI, classes are still injected via the ``ServiceManager``.

  - ``Zend\Mvc\Controller\PluginManager``, mapping to the ``ControllerPluginManager`` service. This is mainly to
    ensure that when falling through to DI, classes are still injected via the ``ServiceManager``.

  - ``Zend\View\Resolver\TemplateMapResolver``, mapping to the ``ViewTemplateMapResolver`` service.

  - ``Zend\View\Resolver\TemplatePathStack``, mapping to the ``ViewTemplatePathStack`` service.

  - ``Zend\View\Resolver\AggregateResolver``, mapping to the ``ViewResolver`` service.

  - ``Zend\View\Resolver\ResolverInterface``, mapping to the ``ViewResolver`` service.

- **Initializers**

  - For objects that implement ``Zend\EventManager\EventManagerAwareInterface``, the
    ``EventManager`` service will be retrieved and injected. This service is **not** shared, though
    each instance it creates is injected with a shared instance of ``SharedEventManager``.

  - For objects that implement ``Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceLocatorAwareInterface``, the
    ``ServiceManager`` will inject itself into the object.

  - The ``ServiceManager`` registers itself as the ``ServiceManager`` service, and aliases itself to
    the class names ``Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceLocatorInterface`` and
    ``Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceManager``.

.. _zend.mvc.services.abstract-factories:

Abstract Factories
------------------

As noted in the previous section, Zend Framework provides a number of abstract service factories by
default. Each is noted below, along with sample configuration.

In each instance, the abstract factory looks for a top-level configuration key, consisting of
key/value pairs where the key is the service name, and the value is the configuration to use to
create the given service.


Zend\\Cache\\Service\\StorageCacheAbstractServiceFactory 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This abstract factory is opt-in, but registered by default in the skeleton application. It uses the
top-level configuration key "caches".

.. code-block:: php
    :linenos:

    return array(
        'caches' => array(
            'Cache\Transient' => array(
                'adapter' => 'redis',
                'ttl'     => 60,
                'plugins' => array(
                    'exception_handler' => array(
                        'throw_exceptions' => false,
                    ),
                ),
            ),
            'Cache\Persistence' => array(
                'adapter' => 'filesystem',
                'ttl'     => 86400,
            ),
        ),
    );

See the :ref:`cache documentation <zend.cache.storage.adapter>` for more configuration options.

Zend\\Db\\Adapter\\AdapterAbstractServiceFactory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This abstract factory is opt-in. It uses the top-level configuration key "db", with a subkey
"adapters".

.. code-block:: php
    :linenos:

    use Zend\Db\Adapter\Adapter;

    return array(
        Adapter::CONFIG => array('adapters' => array(
            'Db\ReadOnly' => array(
                'driver'   => 'Pdo_Sqlite',
                'database' => 'data/db/users.db',
            ),
            'Db\Writeable' => array(
                'driver'   => 'Mysqli',
                'database' => 'users',
                'username' => 'developer',
                'password' => 'developer_password',
            ),
        )),
    );

See the :ref:`DB adapter documentation <zend.db.adapter>` for more configuration options.

Zend\\Form\\FormAbstractServiceFactory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This abstract factory is registered by default. It uses the top-level configuration key "forms".
It makes use of the ``FilterManager``, ``FormElementManager``, ``HydratorManager``,
``InputFilterManager``, and ``ValidatorManager`` plugin managers in order to allow instantiation and
creation of form objects and all related objects in the form hierarchy.

.. code-block:: php
    :linenos:

    return array(
        'forms' => array(
            'Form\Foo' => array(
                'hydrator' => 'ObjectProperty',
                'type'     => 'Zend\Form\Form',
                'elements' => array(
                    array(
                        'spec' => array(
                            'type' => 'Zend\Form\Element\Email',
                            'name' => 'email',
                            'options' => array(
                                'label' => 'Your email address',
                            ),
                        ),
                    ),
                ),
            ),
        ),
    );

Form configuration follows the same configuration you would use with a form factory; the primary
difference is that all plugin managers have already been injected for you, allowing you the
possibility of custom objects or substitutions.

See the :ref:`form factory documentation <zend.form.quick-start.factory>` for more
configuration options.

Zend\\Log\\LoggerAbstractServiceFactory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This abstract factory is opt-in, but registered by default in the skeleton application. It uses the
top-level configuration key "log".

.. code-block:: php
    :linenos:

    return array(
        'log' => array(
            'Log\App' => array(
                'writers' => array(
                    array(
                        'name' => 'stream',
                        'priority' => 1000,
                        'options' => array(
                            'stream' => 'data/logs/app.log',
                        ),
                    ),
                ),
            ),
        ),
    );

See the :ref:`log documentation <zend.log.overview>` for more configuration options.


.. _zend.mvc.services.plugin-managers:

Plugin Managers
---------------

The following plugin managers are configured by default:

- **ControllerManager**, corresponding to ``Zend\Mvc\Controller\ControllerManager``, and used to
  manage controller instances.

- **ControllerPluginManager**, corresponding to ``Zend\Mvc\Controller\PluginManager``, and used to
  manage controller plugin instances.

- **FilterManager**, corresponding to ``Zend\Filter\FilterPluginManager``, and used to
  manage filter instances.

- **FormElementManager**, corresponding to ``Zend\Form\FormElementManager``, and used to
  manage instances of form elements and fieldsets.

- **HydratorManager**, corresponding to ``Zend\Stdlib\Hydrator\HydratorPluginManager``, and used to
  manage hydrator instances.

- **InputFilterManager**, corresponding to ``Zend\InputFilter\InputFilterPluginManager``, and used to
  manage input filter instances.

- **RoutePluginManager**, corresponding to ``Zend\Mvc\Router\RoutePluginManager``, and used to
  manage route instances.

- **SerializerAdapterManager**, corresponding to ``Zend\Serializer\AdapterPluginManager``, and used to
  manage serializer instances.

- **ValidatorManager**, corresponding to ``Zend\Validator\ValidatorPluginManager``, and used to
  manage validator instances.

- **ViewHelperManager**, corresponding to ``Zend\View\HelperPluginManager``, and used to
  manage view helper instances.

As noted in the previous section, all plugin managers share the same configuration and service types
as the standard service manager; they are simply scoped, and only allow instances of certain types
to be created or registered. Default types available are listed in the documentation for each
component.

.. _zend.mvc.services.view-manager:

ViewManager
-----------

The View layer within ``Zend\Mvc`` consists of a large number of collaborators and event listeners. As such,
``Zend\Mvc\View\ViewManager`` was created to handle creation of the various objects, as well as wiring them
together and establishing event listeners.

The ``ViewManager`` itself is an event listener on the ``bootstrap`` event. It retrieves the ``ServiceManager``
from the ``Application`` object, as well as its composed ``EventManager``.

Configuration for all members of the ``ViewManager`` fall under the ``view_manager`` configuration key, and expect
values as noted below. The following services are created and managed by the ``ViewManager``:

- ``ViewHelperManager``, representing and aliased to ``Zend\View\HelperPluginManager``. It is seeded with the
  ``ServiceManager``. Created via the ``Zend\Mvc\Service\ViewHelperManagerFactory``.

  - The ``Router`` service is retrieved, and injected into the ``Url`` helper.

  - If the ``base_path`` key is present, it is used to inject the ``BasePath`` view helper; otherwise, the
    ``Request`` service is retrieved, and the value of its ``getBasePath()`` method is used.

  - If the ``doctype`` key is present, it will be used to set the value of the ``Doctype`` view helper.

- ``ViewTemplateMapResolver``, representing and aliased to ``Zend\View\Resolver\TemplateMapResolver``. If a
  ``template_map`` key is present, it will be used to seed the template map.

- ``ViewTemplatePathStack``, representing and aliased to ``Zend\View\Resolver\TemplatePathStack``.

  - If a ``template_path_stack`` key is present, it will be used to seed the stack.

  - If a ``default_template_suffix`` key is present, it will be used as the default suffix for template scripts
    resolving.

- ``ViewResolver``, representing and aliased to ``Zend\View\Resolver\AggregateResolver`` and
  ``Zend\View\Resolver\ResolverInterface``. It is seeded with the ``ViewTemplateMapResolver`` and
  ``ViewTemplatePathStack`` services as resolvers.

- ``ViewRenderer``, representing and aliased to ``Zend\View\Renderer\PhpRenderer`` and
  ``Zend\View\Renderer\RendererInterface``. It is seeded with the ``ViewResolver`` and ``ViewHelperManager``
  services. Additionally, the ``ViewModel`` helper gets seeded with the ``ViewModel`` as its root (layout) model.

- ``ViewPhpRendererStrategy``, representing and aliased to ``Zend\View\Strategy\PhpRendererStrategy``. It gets
  seeded with the ``ViewRenderer`` service.

- ``View``, representing and aliased to ``Zend\View\View``. It gets seeded with the ``EventManager`` service, and
  attaches the ``ViewPhpRendererStrategy`` as an aggregate listener.

- ``DefaultRenderingStrategy``, representing and aliased to ``Zend\Mvc\View\DefaultRenderingStrategy``. If the
  ``layout`` key is present, it is used to seed the strategy's layout template. It is seeded with the ``View``
  service.

- ``ExceptionStrategy``, representing and aliased to ``Zend\Mvc\View\ExceptionStrategy``. If the
  ``display_exceptions`` or ``exception_template`` keys are present, they are used to configure the strategy.

- ``RouteNotFoundStrategy``, representing and aliased to ``Zend\Mvc\View\RouteNotFoundStrategy`` and
  ``404Strategy``. If the ``display_not_found_reason`` or ``not_found_template`` keys are present, they are used to
  configure the strategy.

- ``ViewModel``. In this case, no service is registered; the ``ViewModel`` is simply retrieved from the
  ``MvcEvent`` and injected with the layout template name.

The ``ViewManager`` also creates several other listeners, but does not expose them as services; these include
``Zend\Mvc\View\CreateViewModelListener``, ``Zend\Mvc\View\InjectTemplateListener``, and
``Zend\Mvc\View\InjectViewModelListener``. These, along with ``RouteNotFoundStrategy``, ``ExceptionStrategy``, and
``DefaultRenderingStrategy`` are attached as listeners either to the application ``EventManager`` instance or the
``SharedEventManager`` instance.

Finally, if you have a ``strategies`` key in your configuration, the ``ViewManager`` will loop over these and
attach them in order to the ``View`` service as listeners, at a priority of 100 (allowing them to execute before
the ``DefaultRenderingStrategy``).

Application Configuration Options
---------------------------------

The following options may be used to provide initial configuration for the ``ServiceManager``, ``ModuleManager``,
and ``Application`` instances, allowing them to then find and aggregate the configuration used for the
``Config`` service, which is intended for configuring all other objects in the system. These configuration
directives go to the ``config/application.config.php`` file.

.. _zend.mvc.services.config:

Default Configuration Options
-----------------------------

The following options are available when using the default services configured by the ``ServiceManagerConfig``
and ``ViewManager``.

These configuration directives can go to the ``config/autoload/{,*.}{global,local}.php`` files, or in the
``module/<module name>/config/module.config.php`` configuration files. The merging of these configuration
files is done by the ``ModuleManager``. It first merges each module's ``module.config.php`` file, and then
the files in ``config/autoload`` (first the ``*.global.php`` and then the ``*.local.php`` files). The order
of the merge is relevant so you can override a module's configuration with your application configuration.
If you have both a ``config/autoload/my.global.config.php`` and ``config/autoload/my.local.config.php``, the
local configuration file overrides the global configuration.

.. warning::

    Local configuration files are intended to keep sensitive information, such as database credentials, and as
    such, it is highly recommended to keep these local configuration files out of your VCS. The
    ``ZendSkeletonApplication``\'s ``config/autoload/.gitignore`` file ignores ``*.local.php`` files by default.
