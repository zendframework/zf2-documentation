Zend\Http\Cookie and Zend\Http\CookieJar
========================================

.. _zend.http.cookies.introduction:

Introduction
------------

``Zend\Http\Cookie``, as expected, is a class that represents an *HTTP* cookie. It provides methods for parsing
*HTTP* response strings, collecting cookies, and easily accessing their properties. It also allows checking if a
cookie matches against a specific scenario, IE a request *URL*, expiration time, secure connection, etc.

``Zend\Http\CookieJar`` is an object usually used by ``Zend\Http\Client`` to hold a set of ``Zend\Http\Cookie``
objects. The idea is that if a ``Zend\Http\CookieJar`` object is attached to a ``Zend\Http\Client`` object, all
cookies going from and into the client through *HTTP* requests and responses will be stored by the CookieJar
object. Then, when the client will send another request, it will first ask the CookieJar object for all cookies
matching the request. These will be added to the request headers automatically. This is highly useful in cases
where you need to maintain a user session over consecutive *HTTP* requests, automatically sending the session ID
cookies when required. Additionally, the ``Zend\Http\CookieJar`` object can be serialized and stored in $_SESSION
when needed.

.. _zend.http.cookies.cookie.instantiating:

Instantiating Zend\Http\Cookie Objects
--------------------------------------

Instantiating a Cookie object can be done in two ways:



   - Through the constructor, using the following syntax: ``new Zend\Http\Cookie(string $name, string $value,
     string $domain, [int $expires, [string $path, [boolean $secure]]]);``

     - ``$name``: The name of the cookie (eg. 'PHPSESSID') (required)

     - ``$value``: The value of the cookie (required)

     - ``$domain``: The cookie's domain (eg. '.example.com') (required)

     - ``$expires``: Cookie expiration time, as UNIX time stamp (optional, defaults to ``NULL``). If not set,
       cookie will be treated as a 'session cookie' with no expiration time.

     - ``$path``: Cookie path, eg. '/foo/bar/' (optional, defaults to '/')

     - ``$secure``: Boolean, Whether the cookie is to be sent over secure (HTTPS) connections only (optional,
       defaults to boolean ``FALSE``)

   - By calling the fromString($cookieStr, [$refUri, [$encodeValue]]) static method, with a cookie string as
     represented in the 'Set-Cookie '*HTTP* response header or 'Cookie'*HTTP* request header. In this case, the
     cookie value must already be encoded. When the cookie string does not contain a 'domain' part, you must
     provide a reference *URI* according to which the cookie's domain and path will be set.

     The ``fromString()`` method accepts the following parameters:

     - ``$cookieStr``: a cookie string as represented in the 'Set-Cookie'*HTTP* response header or 'Cookie'*HTTP*
       request header (required)

     - ``$refUri``: a reference *URI* according to which the cookie's domain and path will be set. (optional,
       defaults to parsing the value from the $cookieStr)

     - ``$encodeValue``: If the value should be passed through urldecode. Also effects the cookie's behavior when
       being converted back to a cookie string. (optional, defaults to true)





      .. _zend.http.cookies.cookie.instantiating.example-1:

      .. rubric:: Instantiating a Zend\Http\Cookie object

      .. code-block:: php
         :linenos:

         // First, using the constructor. This cookie will expire in 2 hours
         $cookie = new Zend\Http\Cookie('foo',
                                        'bar',
                                        '.example.com',
                                        time() + 7200,
                                        '/path');

         // You can also take the HTTP response Set-Cookie header and use it.
         // This cookie is similar to the previous one, only it will not expire, and
         // will only be sent over secure connections
         $cookie = Zend\Http\Cookie::fromString('foo=bar; domain=.example.com; ' .
                                                'path=/path; secure');

         // If the cookie's domain is not set, you have to manually specify it
         $cookie = Zend\Http\Cookie::fromString('foo=bar; secure;',
                                                'http://www.example.com/path');



   .. note::

      When instantiating a cookie object using the ``Zend\Http\Cookie``::fromString() method, the cookie value is
      expected to be *URL* encoded, as cookie strings should be. However, when using the constructor, the cookie
      value string is expected to be the real, decoded value.



A cookie object can be transferred back into a string, using the \__toString() magic method. This method will
produce a *HTTP* request "Cookie" header string, showing the cookie's name and value, and terminated by a semicolon
(';'). The value will be URL encoded, as expected in a Cookie header:



      .. _zend.http.cookies.cookie.instantiating.example-2:

      .. rubric:: Stringifying a Zend\Http\Cookie object

      .. code-block:: php
         :linenos:

         // Create a new cookie
         $cookie = new Zend\Http\Cookie('foo',
                                        'two words',
                                        '.example.com',
                                        time() + 7200,
                                        '/path');

         // Will print out 'foo=two+words;' :
         echo $cookie->__toString();

         // This is actually the same:
         echo (string) $cookie;

         // In PHP 5.2 and higher, this also works:
         echo $cookie;



.. _zend.http.cookies.cookie.accessors:

Zend\Http\Cookie getter methods
-------------------------------

Once a ``Zend\Http\Cookie`` object is instantiated, it provides several getter methods to get the different
properties of the *HTTP* cookie:



   - ``getName()``: Get the name of the cookie

   - ``getValue()``: Get the real, decoded value of the cookie

   - ``getDomain()``: Get the cookie's domain

   - ``getPath()``: Get the cookie's path, which defaults to '/'

   - ``getExpiryTime()``: Get the cookie's expiration time, as UNIX time stamp. If the cookie has no expiration
     time set, will return ``NULL``.



Additionally, several boolean tester methods are provided:



   - ``isSecure()``: Check whether the cookie is set to be sent over secure connections only. Generally speaking,
     if ``TRUE`` the cookie should only be sent over *HTTPS*.

   - ``isExpired(int $time = null)``: Check whether the cookie is expired or not. If the cookie has no expiration
     time, will always return ``TRUE``. If $time is provided, it will override the current time stamp as the time
     to check the cookie against.

   - ``isSessionCookie()``: Check whether the cookie is a "session cookie" - that is a cookie with no expiration
     time, which is meant to expire when the session ends.







      .. _zend.http.cookies.cookie.accessors.example-1:

      .. rubric:: Using getter methods with Zend\Http\Cookie

      .. code-block:: php
         :linenos:

         // First, create the cookie
         $cookie =
             Zend\Http\Cookie::fromString('foo=two+words; ' +
                                          'domain=.example.com; ' +
                                          'path=/somedir; ' +
                                          'secure; ' +
                                          'expires=Wednesday, 28-Feb-05 20:41:22 UTC');

         echo $cookie->getName();   // Will echo 'foo'
         echo $cookie->getValue();  // will echo 'two words'
         echo $cookie->getDomain(); // Will echo '.example.com'
         echo $cookie->getPath();   // Will echo '/'

         echo date('Y-m-d', $cookie->getExpiryTime());
         // Will echo '2005-02-28'

         echo ($cookie->isExpired() ? 'Yes' : 'No');
         // Will echo 'Yes'

         echo ($cookie->isExpired(strtotime('2005-01-01') ? 'Yes' : 'No');
         // Will echo 'No'

         echo ($cookie->isSessionCookie() ? 'Yes' : 'No');
         // Will echo 'No'



.. _zend.http.cookies.cookie.matching:

Zend\Http\Cookie: Matching against a scenario
---------------------------------------------

The only real logic contained in a ``Zend\Http\Cookie`` object, is in the match() method. This method is used to
test a cookie against a given *HTTP* request scenario, in order to tell whether the cookie should be sent in this
request or not. The method has the following syntax and parameters: ``Zend\Http\Cookie->match(mixed $uri, [boolean
$matchSessionCookies, [int $now]]);``

   - ``$uri``: A ``Zend\Uri\Http`` object with a domain name and path to be checked. Optionally, a string
     representing a valid *HTTP* *URL* can be passed instead. The cookie will match if the *URL*'s scheme (HTTP or
     *HTTPS*), domain and path all match.

   - ``$matchSessionCookies``: Whether session cookies should be matched or not. Defaults to ``TRUE``. If set to
     ``FALSE``, cookies with no expiration time will never match.

   - ``$now``: Time (represented as UNIX time stamp) to check a cookie against for expiration. If not specified,
     will default to the current time.





      .. _zend.http.cookies.cookie.matching.example-1:

      .. rubric:: Matching cookies

      .. code-block:: php
         :linenos:

         // Create the cookie object - first, a secure session cookie
         $cookie = Zend\Http\Cookie::fromString('foo=two+words; ' +
                                                'domain=.example.com; ' +
                                                'path=/somedir; ' +
                                                'secure;');

         $cookie->match('https://www.example.com/somedir/foo.php');
         // Will return true

         $cookie->match('http://www.example.com/somedir/foo.php');
         // Will return false, because the connection is not secure

         $cookie->match('https://otherexample.com/somedir/foo.php');
         // Will return false, because the domain is wrong

         $cookie->match('https://example.com/foo.php');
         // Will return false, because the path is wrong

         $cookie->match('https://www.example.com/somedir/foo.php', false);
         // Will return false, because session cookies are not matched

         $cookie->match('https://sub.domain.example.com/somedir/otherdir/foo.php');
         // Will return true

         // Create another cookie object - now, not secure, with expiration time
         // in two hours
         $cookie = Zend\Http\Cookie::fromString('foo=two+words; ' +
                                                'domain=www.example.com; ' +
                                                'expires='
                                                . date(DATE_COOKIE, time() + 7200));

         $cookie->match('http://www.example.com/');
         // Will return true

         $cookie->match('https://www.example.com/');
         // Will return true - non secure cookies can go over secure connections
         // as well!

         $cookie->match('http://subdomain.example.com/');
         // Will return false, because the domain is wrong

         $cookie->match('http://www.example.com/', true, time() + (3 * 3600));
         // Will return false, because we added a time offset of +3 hours to
         // current time



.. _zend.http.cookies.cookiejar:

The Zend\Http\CookieJar Class: Instantiation
--------------------------------------------

In most cases, there is no need to directly instantiate a ``Zend\Http\CookieJar`` object. If you want to attach a
new cookie jar to your ``Zend\Http\Client`` object, just call the Zend\Http\Client->setCookieJar() method, and a
new, empty cookie jar will be attached to your client. You could later get this cookie jar using
Zend\Http\Client->getCookieJar().

If you still wish to manually instantiate a CookieJar object, you can do so by calling "new Zend\Http\CookieJar()"
directly - the constructor method does not take any parameters. Another way to instantiate a CookieJar object is to
use the static Zend\Http\CookieJar::fromResponse() method. This method takes two parameters: a
``Zend\Http\Response`` object, and a reference *URI*, as either a string or a ``Zend\Uri\Http`` object. This method
will return a new ``Zend\Http\CookieJar`` object, already containing the cookies set by the passed *HTTP* response.
The reference *URI* will be used to set the cookie's domain and path, if they are not defined in the Set-Cookie
headers.

.. _zend.http.cookies.cookiejar.adding_cookies:

Adding Cookies to a Zend\Http\CookieJar object
----------------------------------------------

Usually, the ``Zend\Http\Client`` object you attached your CookieJar object to will automatically add cookies set
by *HTTP* responses to your jar. if you wish to manually add cookies to your jar, this can be done by using two
methods:



   - ``Zend\Http\CookieJar->addCookie($cookie[, $ref_uri])``: Add a single cookie to the jar. $cookie can be either
     a ``Zend\Http\Cookie`` object or a string, which will be converted automatically into a Cookie object. If a
     string is provided, you should also provide $ref_uri - which is a reference *URI* either as a string or
     ``Zend\Uri\Http`` object, to use as the cookie's default domain and path.

   - ``Zend\Http\CookieJar->addCookiesFromResponse($response, $ref_uri)``: Add all cookies set in a single *HTTP*
     response to the jar. $response is expected to be a ``Zend\Http\Response`` object with Set-Cookie headers.
     $ref_uri is the request *URI*, either as a string or a ``Zend\Uri\Http`` object, according to which the
     cookies' default domain and path will be set.



.. _zend.http.cookies.cookiejar.getting_cookies:

Retrieving Cookies From a Zend\Http\CookieJar object
----------------------------------------------------

Just like with adding cookies, there is usually no need to manually fetch cookies from a CookieJar object. Your
``Zend\Http\Client`` object will automatically fetch the cookies required for an *HTTP* request for you. However,
you can still use 3 provided methods to fetch cookies from the jar object: ``getCookie()``, ``getAllCookies()``,
and ``getMatchingCookies()``. Additionnaly, iterating over the CookieJar will let you retrieve all the
``Zend\Http\Cookie`` objects from it.

It is important to note that each one of these methods takes a special parameter, which sets the return type of the
method. This parameter can have 3 values:



   - ``Zend\Http\CookieJar::COOKIE_OBJECT``: Return a ``Zend\Http\Cookie`` object. If the method returns more than
     one cookie, an array of objects will be returned.

   - ``Zend\Http\CookieJar::COOKIE_STRING_ARRAY``: Return cookies as strings, in a "foo=bar" format, suitable for
     sending in a *HTTP* request "Cookie" header. If more than one cookie is returned, an array of strings is
     returned.

   - ``Zend\Http\CookieJar::COOKIE_STRING_CONCAT``: Similar to COOKIE_STRING_ARRAY, but if more than one cookie is
     returned, this method will concatenate all cookies into a single, long string separated by semicolons (;), and
     return it. This is especially useful if you want to directly send all matching cookies in a single *HTTP*
     request "Cookie" header.



The structure of the different cookie-fetching methods is described below:



   - ``Zend\Http\CookieJar->getCookie($uri, $cookie_name[, $ret_as])``: Get a single cookie from the jar, according
     to its *URI* (domain and path) and name. $uri is either a string or a ``Zend\Uri\Http`` object representing
     the *URI*. $cookie_name is a string identifying the cookie name. $ret_as specifies the return type as
     described above. $ret_type is optional, and defaults to COOKIE_OBJECT.

   - ``Zend\Http\CookieJar->getAllCookies($ret_as)``: Get all cookies from the jar. $ret_as specifies the return
     type as described above. If not specified, $ret_type defaults to COOKIE_OBJECT.

   - ``Zend\Http\CookieJar->getMatchingCookies($uri[, $matchSessionCookies[, $ret_as[, $now]]])``: Get all cookies
     from the jar that match a specified scenario, that is a *URI* and expiration time.



        - ``$uri`` is either a ``Zend\Uri\Http`` object or a string specifying the connection type (secure or
          non-secure), domain and path to match against.

        - ``$matchSessionCookies`` is a boolean telling whether to match session cookies or not. Session cookies
          are cookies that have no specified expiration time. Defaults to ``TRUE``.

        - ``$ret_as`` specifies the return type as described above. If not specified, defaults to COOKIE_OBJECT.

        - ``$now`` is an integer representing the UNIX time stamp to consider as "now" - that is any cookies who
          are set to expire before this time will not be matched. If not specified, defaults to the current time.
