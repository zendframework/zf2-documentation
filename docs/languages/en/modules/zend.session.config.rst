Custom Configuration
--------------------

In the event that you prefer to create your own session configuration; you *must* implement
``Zend\Session\Config\ConfigInterface`` which contains the basic interface for items needed when implementing a session.
This includes cookie configuration, lifetime, session name, save path and an interface for getting and setting options.
