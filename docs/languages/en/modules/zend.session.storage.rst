===============

the intermediary between when the session starts and when the session writes and closes.  The default session storage
is ``Zend\Session\Storage\SessionArrayStorage``.

Custom Storage
--------------

In the event that you prefer a different type of storage; to create a new custom storage container, you *must* implement
``Zend\Session\Storage\StorageInterface`` which is mostly in implementing ArrayAccess, Traversable, Serializable and
Countable.  StorageInterface defines some additional functionality that must be implemented.
