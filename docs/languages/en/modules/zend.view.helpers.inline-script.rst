InlineScript Helper
===================

The *HTML* **<script>** element is used to either provide inline client-side scripting elements or link to a remote
resource containing client-side scripting code. The ``InlineScript`` helper allows you to manage both. It is
derived from :ref:`HeadScript <zend.view.helpers.initial.headscript>`, and any method of that helper is available;
however, use the ``inlineScript()`` method in place of ``headScript()``.

.. note:: Use InlineScript for HTML Body Scripts

   ``InlineScript``, should be used when you wish to include scripts inline in the *HTML* **body**. Placing scripts
   at the end of your document is a good practice for speeding up delivery of your page, particularly when using
   3rd party analytics scripts.

   Some JS libraries need to be included in the *HTML* **head**; use :ref:`HeadScript
   <zend.view.helpers.initial.headscript>` for those scripts.
