Introduction
============

The ``Zend\Server`` family of classes provides functionality for the various server classes, including
``Zend\XmlRpc\Server`` and ``Zend\Json\Server``. ``Zend\Server\Server`` provides an interface that mimics *PHP* 5's
``SoapServer`` class; all server classes should implement this interface in order to provide a standard server *API*.

The ``Zend\Server\Reflection`` tree provides a standard mechanism for performing function and class introspection
for use as callbacks with the server classes, and provides data suitable for use with ``Zend\Server\Server``'s
``getFunctions()`` and ``loadFunctions()`` methods.
