=======

Routing is the act of matching a request to a given controller.

Typically, routing will examine the request URI, and attempt to match the URI path segment against provided
constraints. If the constraints match, a set of "matches" are returned, one of which should be the controller name
to execute. Routing can utilize other portions of the request URI or environment as well -- for example, the host
or scheme, query parameters, headers, request method, and more.

Routing has been written from the ground up for Zend Framework 2.0. Execution is quite similar, but the internal
workings are more consistent, performant, and often simpler.

.. note::

    If you are a developer with knowledge of the routing system in Zend Framework 1.x, you should know that some of
    the old terminology does not apply in Zend Framework 2.x. In the new routing system we don't have a router as
    such, as every route can match and assemble URIs by themselves, which makes them routers, too.

    That said, in most cases the developer does not need to worry about this, because Zend Framework 2.x will take
    care of this "under the hood". The work of the router will be done by ``Zend\Mvc\Router\SimpleRouteStack``
    or ``Zend\Mvc\Router\Http\TreeRouteStack``.

The base unit of routing is a ``Route``:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   namespace Zend\Mvc\Router;

   use zend\Stdlib\RequestInterface as Request;

   interface RouteInterface
   {
       public static function factory(array $options = array());
       public function match(Request $request);
       public function assemble(array $params = array(), array $options = array());
   }

A ``Route`` accepts a ``Request``, and determines if it matches. If so, it returns a ``RouteMatch`` object:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   namespace Zend\Mvc\Router;

   class RouteMatch
   {
       public function __construct(array $params);
       public function setMatchedRouteName($name);
       public function getMatchedRouteName();
       public function setParam($name, $value);
       public function getParams();
       public function getParam($name, $default = null);
   }

Typically, when a ``Route`` matches, it will define one or more parameters. These are passed into the
``RouteMatch``, and objects may query the ``RouteMatch`` for their values.

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   $id = $routeMatch->getParam('id', false);
   if (!$id) {
       throw new Exception('Required identifier is missing!');
   }
   $entity = $resource->get($id);

Usually you will have multiple routes you wish to test against. In order to facilitate this, you will use a route
aggregate, usually implementing ``RouteStack``:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   namespace Zend\Mvc\Router;

   interface RouteStackInterface extends RouteInterface
   {
       public function addRoute($name, $route, $priority = null);
       public function addRoutes(array $routes);
       public function removeRoute($name);
       public function setRoutes(array $routes);
   }

Typically, routes should be queried in a LIFO order, and hence the reason behind the name ``RouteStack``. Zend
Framework provides two implementations of this interface, ``SimpleRouteStack`` and ``TreeRouteStack``. In each, you
register routes either one at a time using ``addRoute()``, or in bulk using ``addRoutes()``.

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   // One at a time:
   $route = Literal::factory(array(
       'route' => '/foo',
       'defaults' => array(
           'controller' => 'foo-index',
           'action'     => 'index',
       ),
   ));
   $router->addRoute('foo', $route);

   // In bulk:
   $router->addRoutes(array(
       // using already instantiated routes:
       'foo' => $route,

       // providing configuration to allow lazy-loading routes:
       'bar' => array(
           'type' => 'literal',
           'options' => array(
               'route' => '/bar',
               'defaults' => array(
                   'controller' => 'bar-index',
                   'action'     => 'index',
               ),
           ),
       ),
   ));

.. _zend.mvc.routing.router-types:

Router Types
------------

Two routers are provided, the ``SimpleRouteStack`` and ``TreeRouteStack``. Each works with the above interface, but
utilize slightly different options and execution paths. By default, the ``Zend\Mvc`` uses the ``TreeRouteStack`` as
the router.

.. _zend.mvc.routing.router-types.simple-route-stack:

SimpleRouteStack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This router simply takes individual routes that provide their full matching logic in one go, and loops through them
in LIFO order until a match is found. As such, routes that will match most often should be registered last, and
least common routes first. Additionally, you will need to ensure that routes that potentially overlap are
registered such that the most specific match will match first (i.e., register later). Alternatively, you can set
priorities by giving the priority as third parameter to the ``addRoute()`` method, specifying the priority in the
route specifications or setting the priority property within a route instance before adding it to the route stack.

.. _zend.mvc.routing.router-types.tree-route-stack:

TreeRouteStack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``Zend\Mvc\Router\Http\TreeRouteStack`` provides the ability to register trees of routes, and will use a B-tree
algorithm to match routes. As such, you register a single route with many children.

A ``TreeRouteStack`` will consist of the following configuration:

- A base "route", which describes the base match needed, the root of the tree.

- An optional "route_plugins", which is a configured ``Zend\Mvc\Router\RoutePluginManager`` that can lazy-load routes.

- The option "may_terminate", which hints to the router that no other segments will follow it.

- An optional "child_routes" array, which contains additional routes that stem from the base "route" (i.e., build
  from it). Each child route can itself be a ``TreeRouteStack`` if desired; in fact, the ``Part`` route works
  exactly this way.

When a route matches against a ``TreeRouteStack``, the matched parameters from each segment of the tree will be
returned.

A ``TreeRouteStack`` can be your sole route for your application, or describe particular path segments of the
application.

An example of a ``TreeRouteStack`` is provided in the documentation of the ``Part`` route.

.. _zend.mvc.routing.http-route-types:

HTTP Route Types
----------------

Zend Framework 2.0 ships with the following HTTP route types.

.. _zend.mvc.routing.http-route-types.hostname:

Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Hostname
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``Hostname`` route attempts to match the hostname registered in the request against specific criteria.
Typically, this will be in one of the following forms:

- "subdomain.domain.tld"

- ":subdomain.domain.tld"

In the above, the second route would return a "subdomain" key as part of the route match.

For any given hostname segment, you may also provide a constraint. As an example, if the "subdomain" segment needed
to match only if it started with "fw" and contained exactly 2 digits following, the following route would be
needed:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   $route = Hostname::factory(array(
       'route' => ':subdomain.domain.tld',
       'constraints' => array(
           'subdomain' => 'fw\d{2}'
       ),
   ));

In the above example, only a "subdomain" key will be returned in the ``RouteMatch``. If you wanted to also provide
other information based on matching, or a default value to return for the subdomain, you need to also provide
defaults.

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   $route = Hostname::factory(array(
       'route' => ':subdomain.domain.tld',
       'constraints' => array(
           'subdomain' => 'fw\d{2}'
       ),
       'defaults' => array(
           'type' => 'json',
       ),
   ));

When matched, the above will return two keys in the ``RouteMatch``, "subdomain" and "type".

.. _zend.mvc.routing.http-route-types.literal:

Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Literal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``Literal`` route is for doing exact matching of the URI path. Configuration therefore is solely the path you
want to match, and the "defaults", or parameters you want returned on a match.

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   $route = Literal::factory(array(
       'route' => '/foo',
       'defaults' => array(
           'controller' => 'Application\Controller\IndexController',
           'action' => 'foo'
       ),
   ));

The above route would match a path "/foo", and return the key "controller" in the ``RouteMatch``, with the value
"foo-index".

.. _zend.mvc.routing.http-route-types.method:

Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``Method`` route is used to match the http method or 'verb' specified in the request (See RFC 2616 Sec. 5.1.1).
It can optionally be configured to match against multiple methods by providing a comma-separated list of method
tokens.

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   $route = Method::factory(array(
       'verb' => 'post,put',
       'defaults' => array(
           'controller' => 'Application\Controller\IndexController',
           'action' => 'form-submit'
       ),
   ));

The above route would match an http "POST" or "PUT" request and return a ``RouteMatch`` object containing a key
"action" with a value of "form-submit".

.. _zend.mvc.routing.http-route-types.part:

Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Part
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``Part`` route allows crafting a tree of possible routes based on segments of the URI path. It actually extends
the ``TreeRouteStack``.

``Part`` routes are difficult to describe, so we'll simply provide a sample one here.

.. code-block:: php
    :linenos:

    $route = Part::factory(array(
        'route' => array(
            'type' => 'literal',
            'options' => array(
                'route' => '/',
                'defaults' => array(
                    'controller' => 'Application\Controller\IndexController',
                    'action' => 'index'
                )
            ),
        ),
        'route_plugins' => $routePlugins,
        'may_terminate' => true,
        'child_routes' => array(
            'blog' => array(
                'type' => 'literal',
                'options' => array(
                    'route' => 'blog',
                    'defaults' => array(
                        'controller' => 'Application\Controller\BlogController',
                        'action' => 'index'
                    )
                ),
                'may_terminate' => true,
                'child_routes' => array(
                    'rss' => array(
                        'type' => 'literal',
                        'options' => array(
                            'route' => '/rss',
                            'defaults' => array(
                                'action' => 'rss'
                            )
                        ),
                        'may_terminate' => true,
                        'child_routes' => array(
                            'subrss' => array(
                                'type' => 'literal',
                                'options' => array(
                                    'route' => '/sub',
                                    'defaults' => array(
                                        'action' => 'subrss'
                                    )
                                )
                            )
                        )
                    )
                )
            ),
            'forum' => array(
                'type' => 'literal',
                'options' => array(
                    'route' => 'forum',
                    'defaults' => array(
                        'controller' => 'Application\Controller\ForumController',
                        'action' => 'index'
                    )
                )
            )
        )
    ));


The above would match the following:

- "/" would load the "Index" controller, "index" action.

- "/blog" would load the "Blog" controller, "index" action.

- "/blog/rss" would load the "Blog" controller, "rss" action.

- "/blog/rss/sub" would load the "Blog" controller, "subrss" action.

- "/forum" would load the "Forum" controller, "index" action.

You may use any route type as a child route of a ``Part`` route.

.. note::

    ``Part`` routes are not meant to be used directly. When you add definitions for ``child_routes`` to any route
    type, that route will become a ``Part`` route. As already said, describing ``Part`` routes with words is
    difficult, so hopefully the additional :ref:`examples at the end <zend.mvc.routing.http-route-types.examples>`
    will provide further insight.

.. note::

    In the above example, the ``$routePlugins`` is an instance of ``Zend\Mvc\Router\RoutePluginManager``.

    .. code-block:: php
        :linenos:

        $routePlugins = new Zend\Mvc\Router\RoutePluginManager();
        $plugins = array(
            'hostname' => 'Zend\Mvc\Http\Route\Hostname',
            'literal' => 'Zend\Mvc\Http\Route\Literal',
            'part' => 'Zend\Mvc\Http\Route\Part',
            'regex' => 'Zend\Mvc\Http\Route\Regex',
            'scheme' => 'Zend\Mvc\Http\Route\Scheme',
            'segment' => 'Zend\Mvc\Http\Route\Segment',
            'wildcard' => 'Zend\Mvc\Http\Route\Wildcard',
            'query' => 'Zend\Mvc\Http\Route\Query',
            'method' => 'Zend\Mvc\Http\Route\Method'
        );
        $foreach ($plugins as $name => $class) {
            $routePlugins->setInvokableClass($name, $class);
        }

    When using ``Zend\Mvc\Router\Http\TreeRouteStack``, the ``RoutePluginManager`` is set up by default, and the
    developer does not need to worry about the autoloading of standard HTTP routes.

.. _zend.mvc.routing.http-route-types.regex:

Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Regex
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``Regex`` route utilizes a regular expression to match against the URI path. Any valid regular expession is
allowed; our recommendation is to use named captures for any values you want to return in the ``RouteMatch``.

Since regular expression routes are often complex, you must specify a "spec" or specification to use when
assembling URLs from regex routes. The spec is simply a string; replacements are identified using "%keyname%"
within the string, with the keys coming from either the captured values or named parameters passed to the
``assemble()`` method.

Just like other routes, the ``Regex`` route can accept "defaults", parameters to include in the ``RouteMatch`` when
successfully matched.

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   $route = Regex::factory(array(
       'regex' => '/blog/(?<id>[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)(\.(?<format>(json|html|xml|rss)))?',
       'defaults' => array(
           'controller' => 'Application\Controller\BlogController',
           'action'     => 'view',
           'format'     => 'html',
       ),
       'spec' => '/blog/%id%.%format%',
   ));

The above would match "/blog/001-some-blog_slug-here.html", and return four items in the ``RouteMatch``, an "id",
the "controller", the "action", and the "format". When assembling a URL from this route, the "id" and "format" values would be
used to fill the specification.

.. _zend.mvc.routing.http-route-types.scheme:

Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Scheme
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``Scheme`` route matches the URI scheme only, and must be an exact match. As such, this route, like the
``Literal`` route, simply takes what you want to match and the "defaults", parameters to return on a match.

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   $route = Scheme::factory(array(
       'scheme' => 'https',
       'defaults' => array(
           'https' => true,
       ),
   ));

The above route would match the "https" scheme, and return the key "https" in the ``RouteMatch`` with a boolean
``true`` value.

.. _zend.mvc.routing.http-route-types.segment:

Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Segment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``Segment`` route allows matching any segment of a URI path. Segments are denoted using a colon, followed by
alphanumeric characters; if a segment is optional, it should be surrounded by brackets. As an example,
"/:foo[/:bar]" would match a "/" followed by text and assign it to the key "foo"; if any additional "/" characters
are found, any text following the last one will be assigned to the key "bar".

The separation between literal and named segments can be anything. For example, the above could be done as
"/:foo{-}[-:bar] as well. The {-} after the :foo parameter indicates a set of one or more delimiters, after which
matching of the parameter itself ends.

Each segment may have constraints associated with it. Each constraint should simply be a regular expression
expressing the conditions under which that segment should match.

Also, as you can in other routes, you may provide defaults to use; these are particularly useful when using
optional segments.

As a complex example:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   $route = Segment::factory(array(
       'route' => '/:controller[/:action]',
       'constraints' => array(
           'controller' => '[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]+',
           'action'     => '[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]+',
       ),
       'defaults' => array(
           'controller' => 'Application\Controller\IndexController',
           'action'     => 'index',
       ),
   ));

.. _zend.mvc.routing.http-route-types.query:

Zend\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Query
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``Query`` route part allows you to specify and capture query string parameters for a given route.

The intention of the ``Query`` part is that you do not instantiate it in its own right but to use it as a child of
another route part.

An example of its usage would be

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   $route = Part::factory(array(
       'route' => array(
           'type'    => 'literal',
           'options' => array(
               'route'    => 'page',
               'defaults' => array(
               ),
           ),
       ),
       'may_terminate' => true,
       'route_plugins'  => $routePlugins,
       'child_routes'  => array(
           'query' => array(
               'type' => 'Query',
               'options' => array(
                   'defaults' => array(
                       'foo' => 'bar'
                   )
               )
           ),
       ),
   ));

As you can see, it's pretty straight forward to specify the query part. This then allows you to create query
strings using the url view helper.

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   $this->url(
       'page/query',
       array(
           'name'=>'my-test-page',
           'format' => 'rss',
           'limit' => 10,
       )
   );

As you can see above, you must add "/query" to your route name in order to append a query string. If you do not
specify "/query" in the route name then no query string will be appended.

Our example "page" route has only one defined parameter of "name" ("/page[/:name]"), meaning that the remaining
parameters of "format" and "limit" will then be appended as a query string.

The output from our example should then be "/page/my-test-page?format=rss&limit=10"

HTTP Routing Examples

Most of the routing definitions will be done in module configuration files, so the following examples will show
how to set up routes in config files.

                        'route' => 'contact',
                        'defaults' => array(
                            'controller' => 'Application\Controller\ContactController',
                            'action' => 'form'
                        )
                    )

When using child routes, naming of the routes follows the ``parent/child`` pattern, so to use the child routes
from the above example:

.. code-block:: php
    :linenos:

    echo $this->url('blog'); // gives "/blog"
    echo $this->url('blog/post', array('slug' => 'my-post')); // gives "/blog/my-post"
    echo $this->url('blog/rss'); // gives "/blog/rss"

.. warning::

    When defining child routes pay attentiont that the ``may_terminate`` and ``child_routes`` definitions
    are in same level as the ``options`` and ``type`` definitions. A common pitfal is to have those two
    definitions nested in ``options``, which will not result in the desired routes.

Console Route Types
-------------------

Zend Framework 2.0 also comes with routes for writing Console based applications, which is explained in the
:ref:`Console routes and routing <zend.console.routes>` section.
