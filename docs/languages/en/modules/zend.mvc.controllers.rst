Available Controllers
=====================

Controllers in the MVC layer simply need to be objects implementing ``Zend\Stdlib\DispatchableInterface``. That
interface describes a single method:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   use Zend\Stdlib\DispatchableInterface;
   use Zend\Stdlib\RequestInterface as Request;
   use Zend\Stdlib\ResponseInterface as Response;

   class Foo implements DispatchableInterface
   {
       public function dispatch(Request $request, Response $response = null)
       {
           // ... do something, and preferably return a Response ...
       }
   }

While this pattern is simple enough, chances are you don't want to implement custom dispatch logic for every
controller (particularly as it's not unusual or uncommon for a single controller to handle several related types of
requests).

The MVC also defines several interfaces that, when implemented, can provide controllers with additional
capabilities.

.. _zend.mvc.controllers.interfaces:

Common Interfaces Used With Controllers
---------------------------------------

.. _zend.mvc.controllers.interfaces.inject-application-event:

InjectApplicationEvent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``Zend\Mvc\InjectApplicationEventInterface`` hints to the ``Application`` instance that it should inject its
``MvcEvent`` into the controller itself. Why would this be useful?

Recall that the ``MvcEvent`` composes a number of objects: the ``Request`` and ``Response``, naturally, but also
the router, the route matches (a ``RouteMatch`` instance), and potentially the "result" of dispatching.

A controller that has the ``MvcEvent`` injected, then, can retrieve or inject these. As an example:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   $matches = $this->getEvent()->getRouteMatch();
   $id      = $matches->getParam('id', false);
   if (!$id) {
       $response = $this->getResponse();
       $response->setStatusCode(500);
       $this->getEvent()->setResult('Invalid identifier; cannot complete request');
       return;
   }

The ``InjectApplicationEventInterface`` defines simply two methods:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   public function setEvent(Zend\EventManager\EventInterface $event);
   public function getEvent();

.. _zend.mvc.controllers.interfaces.service-locator-aware:

ServiceLocatorAware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In most cases, you should define your controllers such that dependencies are injected by the application's
``ServiceManager``, via either constructor arguments or setter methods.

However, occasionally you may have objects you wish to use in your controller that are only valid for certain code
paths. Examples include forms, paginators, navigation, etc. In these cases, you may decide that it doesn't make
sense to inject those objects every time the controller is used.

The ``ServiceLocatorAwareInterface`` interface hints to the ``ServiceManager`` that it should inject itself into
the controller. It defines two simple methods:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   use Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceLocatorInterface;
   use Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceLocatorAwareInterface;

   public function setServiceLocator(ServiceLocatorInterface $serviceLocator);
   public function getServiceLocator();

.. _zend.mvc.controllers.interfaces.event-manager-aware:

EventManagerAware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Typically, it's nice to be able to tie into a controller's workflow without needing to extend it or hardcode
behavior into it. The solution for this at the framework level is to use the ``EventManager``.

You can hint to the ``ServiceManager`` that you want an ``EventManager`` injected by implementing the interface
``EventManagerAwareInterface``, which  tells the ``ServiceManager`` to inject an ``EventManager``.

You define two methods. The first, a setter, should also set any ``EventManager`` identifiers you want to
listen on, and the second, a getter, should simply return the composed ``EventManager`` instance.

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   use Zend\EventManager\EventManagerAwareInterface;
   use Zend\EventManager\EventManagerInterface;

   public function setEventManager(EventManagerInterface $events);
   public function getEventManager();

.. _zend.mvc.controllers.interfaces.pluggable:

Controller Plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Code re-use is a common goal for developers. Another common goal is convenience. However, this is often difficult
to achieve cleanly in abstract, general systems.

Within your controllers, you'll often find yourself repeating tasks from one controller to another. Some common
examples:

- Generating URLs

- Redirecting

- Setting and retrieving flash messages (self-expiring session messages)

- Invoking and dispatching additional controllers

To facilitate these actions while also making them available to alternate controller implementations, we've created
a ``PluginManager`` implementation for the controller layer, ``Zend\Mvc\Controller\PluginManager``, building on the
``Zend\ServiceManager\AbstractPluginManager`` functionality. To utilize it, you simply need to implement the
``setPluginManager(PluginManager $plugins)`` method, and set up your code to use the controller-specific implementation by default:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   use Zend\Mvc\Controller\PluginManager;

   public function setPluginManager(PluginManager $plugins)
   {
       $this->plugins = $plugins;
       $this->plugins->setController($this);

       return $this;
   }

   public function getPluginManager()
   {
       if (!$this->plugins) {
           $this->setPluginManager(new PluginManager());
       }

       return $this->plugins;
   }

   public function plugin($name, array $options = null)
   {
       return $this->getPluginManager()->get($name, $options);
   }

.. _zend.mvc.controllers.action-controller:

The AbstractActionController
----------------------------

Implementing each of the above interfaces is a lesson in redundancy; you won't often want to do it. As such, we've
developed two abstract, base controllers you can extend to get started.

The first is ``Zend\Mvc\Controller\AbstractActionController``. This controller implements each of the above
interfaces, and uses the following assumptions:

- An "action" parameter is expected in the ``RouteMatch`` object composed in the attached ``MvcEvent``. If none is
  found, a ``notFoundAction()`` is invoked.

- The "action" parameter is converted to a camelCased format and appended with the word "Action" to create a method
  name. As examples: "foo" maps to "fooAction", "foo-bar" or "foo.bar" or "foo_bar" to "fooBarAction". The
  controller then checks to see if that method exists. If not, the ``notFoundAction()`` method is invoked;
  otherwise, the discovered method is called.

- The results of executing the given action method are injected into the ``MvcEvent``'s "result" property (via
  ``setResult()``, and accesible via ``getResult()``).

Essentially, a route mapping to an ``AbstractActionController`` needs to return both "controller" and "action" keys
in its matches.

Creation of action controllers is then reasonably trivial:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   namespace Foo\Controller;

   use Zend\Mvc\Controller\AbstractActionController;

   class BarController extends AbstractActionController
   {
       public function bazAction()
       {
           return array('title' => __METHOD__);
       }

       public function batAction()
       {
           return array('title' => __METHOD__);
       }
   }

.. _zend.mvc.controllers.action-controller.interfaces-and-collaborators:

Interfaces and Collaborators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``AbstractActionController`` implements each of the following interfaces:

- ``Zend\Stdlib\DispatchableInterface``

- ``Zend\Mvc\InjectApplicationEventInterface``

- ``Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceLocatorAwareInterface``

- ``Zend\EventManager\EventManagerAwareInterface``

The composed ``EventManager`` will be configured to listen on the following contexts:

- ``Zend\Stdlib\DispatchableInterface``

- ``Zend\Mvc\Controller\AbstractActionController``

Additionally, if you extend the class, it will listen on the extending class's name.

.. _zend.mvc.controllers.restful-controller:

The AbstractRestfulController
-----------------------------

The second abstract controller ZF2 provides is ``Zend\Mvc\Controller\AbstractRestfulController``. This controller
provides a naive RESTful implementation that simply maps HTTP request methods to controller methods, using the
following matrix:

- **GET** maps to either ``get()`` or ``getList()``, depending on whether or not an "id" parameter is found in the
  route matches. If one is, it is passed as an argument to ``get()``; if not, ``getList()`` is invoked. In the
  former case, you should provide a representation of the given entity with that identification; in the latter, you
  should provide a list of entities.

- **POST** maps to ``create()``. That method expects a ``$data`` argument, usually the ``$_POST`` superglobal
  array. The data should be used to create a new entitiy, and the response should typically be an HTTP 201 response
  with the Location header indicating the URI of the newly created entity and the response body providing the
  representation.

- **PUT** maps to ``update()``, and requires that an "id" parameter exists in the route matches; that value is
  passed as an argument to the method. It should attempt to update the given entity, and, if successful, return
  either a 200 or 202 response status, as well as the representation of the entity.

- **DELETE** maps to ``delete()``, and requires that an "id" parameter exists in the route matches; that value is
  passed as an argument to the method. It should attempt to delete the given entity, and, if successful, return
  either a 200 or 204 response status.

Additionally, you can map "action" methods to the ``AbstractRestfulController``, just as you would in the
``AbstractActionController``; these methods will be suffixed with "Action", differentiating them from the RESTful
methods listed above. This allows you to perform such actions as providing forms used to submit to the various
RESTful methods, or to add RPC methods to your RESTful API.

.. _zend.mvc.controllers.restful-controller.interfaces-and-collaborators:

Interfaces and Collaborators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``AbstractRestfulController`` implements each of the following interfaces:

- ``Zend\Stdlib\DispatchableInterface``

- ``Zend\Mvc\InjectApplicationEventInterface``

- ``Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceLocatorAwareInterface``

- ``Zend\EventManager\EventManagerAwareInterface``

The composed ``EventManager`` will be configured to listen on the following contexts:

- ``Zend\Stdlib\DispatchableInterface``

- ``Zend\Mvc\Controller\AbstractActionController``

Additionally, if you extend the class, it will listen on the extending class's name.
