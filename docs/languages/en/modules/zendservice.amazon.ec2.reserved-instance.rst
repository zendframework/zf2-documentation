ZendService\Amazon\Ec2: Reserved Instances
===========================================

With Amazon *EC2* Reserved Instances, you can make a low one-time payment for each instance to reserve and receive
a significant discount on the hourly usage charge for that instance.

Amazon *EC2* Reserved Instances are based on instance type and location (region and Availability Zone) for a
specified period of time (e.g., 1 year or 3 years) and are only available for Linux or UNIX instances.

How Reserved Instances are Applied
----------------------------------

Reserved Instances are applied to instances that meet the type/location criteria during the specified period. In
this example, a user is running the following instances:

- (4) m1.small instances in Availability Zone us-east-1a

- (4) c1.medium instances in Availability Zone us-east-1b

- (2) c1.xlarge instances in Availability Zone us-east-1b

The user then purchases the following Reserved Instances.

- (2) m1.small instances in Availability Zone us-east-1a

- (2) c1.medium instances in Availability Zone us-east-1a

- (2) m1.xlarge instances in Availability Zone us-east-1a

Amazon *EC2* applies the two m1.small Reserved Instances to two of the instances in Availability Zone us-east-1a.
Amazon *EC2* doesn't apply the two c1.medium Reserved Instances because the c1.medium instances are in a different
Availability Zone and does not apply the m1.xlarge Reserved Instances because there are no running m1.xlarge
instances.
