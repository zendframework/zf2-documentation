BasePath Helper
==============

While most *URL*\ s generated by the framework have the base *URL* prepended automatically, developers will need to
prepend the base *URL* to their own *URL*\ s (usually inside a href attribute) in order for paths to resources to be correct.

If you're running on ZF2's MVC base, BasePath will point to the \public folder on the Application root.

Usage of the BasePath helper is very straightforward:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   /*
    * The following assume that the base URL of the page/application is "/mypage".
    */

   /*
    * Prints:
    * <a href="/mypage/" />
    */
   <a href="<?php echo $this->BasePath(); ?>" />

   /*
    * Prints:
    * <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/mypage/css/base.css" />
    */
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
        href="<?php echo $this->BasePath('css/base.css'); ?>" />

.. note::

   For simplicity's sake, we strip out the entry *PHP* file (e.g., "``index.php``") from the base *URL* that was
   contained in ``Zend_Controller``. However, in some situations this may cause a problem. If one occurs, use
   ``$this->getHelper('BasePath')->setBasePath()`` to set your own BaseUrl.
