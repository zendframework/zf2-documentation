Introduction to the MVC Layer
=============================

``Zend\Mvc`` is a brand new MVC implementation designed from the ground up for Zend Framework 2.0. The focus of
this implementation is performance and flexibility.

The MVC layer is built on top of the following components:

- ``Zend\ServiceManager``. Zend Framework provides a set of default service definitions to use in order to create
  and configure your application instance and workflow.

- ``Zend\EventManager``, which is used everywhere from initial bootstrapping of the application to returning the
  response; the MVC is event driven.

- ``Zend\Http``, specifically the request and response objects, which are used with:

- ``Zend\Stdlib\DispatchableInterface``; all "controllers" are simply dispatchable objects

Within the MVC layer, several subcomponents are exposed:

- ``Zend\Mvc\Router`` contains classes pertaining to routing a request (the act of matching a request to a
  controller, or dispatchable)

- ``Zend\Mvc\PhpEnvironment``, a set of decorators for the HTTP ``Request`` and ``Response`` objects that ensure
  the request is injected with the current environment (including query parameters, POST parameters, HTTP headers,
  etc.)

- ``Zend\Mvc\Controller``, a set of abstract "controller" classes with basic responsibilities such as event wiring,
  action dispatching, etc.

- ``Zend\Mvc\Service``, which provides a set of ``ServiceManager`` factories and definitions for the default
  application workflow.

- ``Zend\Mvc\View``, which provides the default wiring for renderer selection, view script resolution, helper
  registration, and more; additionally, it provides a number of listeners that tie into the MVC workflow to provide
  features such as automated template name resolution, automated view model creation and injection, and more.

The gateway to the MVC is the ``Zend\Mvc\Application`` object (referred to simply as ``Application`` from this
point forward). Its primary responsibilities are to **bootstrap** resources, **route** the request, and to retrieve
and **dispatch** the controller discovered. Once accomplished, it returns a response, which can then be **sent**.

.. _zend.mvc.intro.basic-application-structure:

Basic Application Structure
---------------------------

The basic structure of an application is as follows:


::

   application_root/
       config/
           application.php
           autoload/
               global.php
               local.php
               // etc.
       data/
       module/
       vendor/
       public/
           .htaccess
           index.php

The ``public/index.php`` performs the basic work of martialling configuration and configuring the ``Application``.
Once done, it ``run()``\ s the ``Application`` and ``send()``\ s the response returned.

The ``config`` directory will typically contain configuration used by ``Zend\Module\Manager`` in order to load
modules and merge configuration; we will detail this more later.

The ``vendor`` subdirectory should contain any third-party modules or libraries on which your application depends.
This might include Zend Framework, custom libraries from your organization, or other third-party libraries from
other projects. Libraries and modules placed in the ``vendor`` subdirectory should not be modified from their
original, distributed state.

Finally, the ``module`` directory will contain one or more modules delivering your application's functionality.

Let's now turn to modules, as they are the basic units of a web application.

.. _zend.mvc.intro.basic-module-structure:

Basic Module Structure
----------------------

A module may contain just about anything: PHP code, including MVC functionality; library code; view scripts; and/or
or public assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript. The one requirement -- and even this is optional -- is that a
module acts as a PHP namespace and that it contains a ``Module`` class under that namespace. This class will then
be consumed by ``Zend\Module\Manager`` in order to perform a number of tasks.

The recommended structure of a module is as follows:


::

   module_root/
       Module.php
       autoload_classmap.php
       autoload_function.php
       autoload_register.php
       config/
           module.config.php
       public/
           images/
           css/
           js/
       src/
           <module_namespace>/
               <code files>
       test/
           phpunit.xml
           bootstrap.php
           <module_namespace>/
               <test code files>
       view/
           <dir-named-after-module-namespace>/
               <dir-named-after-a-controller>/
                   <.phtml files>

Since a module acts as a namespace, the module root directory should be that namespace. Typically, this namespace
will also include a vendor prefix of sorts. As an example a module centered around "User" functionality delivered
by Zend might be named "ZendUser", and this is also what the module root directory will be named.

The ``Module.php`` file directly under the module root directory will be in the module namespace.

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   namespace ZendUser;

   class Module
   {
   }

By default, if an ``init()`` method is defined, this method will be triggered by a ``Zend\Module\Manager`` listener
when it loads the module class, and passed an instance of the manager. This allows you to perform tasks such as
setting up module-specific event listeners. The ``init()`` method is called for **every** module on **every** page
request and should **only** be used for performing **lightweight** tasks such as registering event listeners.
Similarly, an ``onBootstrap()`` method (which accepts an ``MvcEvent`` instance) may be defined; it will be
triggered for every page request, and should be used for lightweight tasks only.

The three ``autoload_*.php`` files are not required, but recommended. They provide the following:

- ``autoload_classmap.php`` should return an array classmap of class name/filename pairs (with the filenames
  resolved via the ``__DIR__`` magic constant).

- ``autoload_function.php`` should return a PHP callback that can be passed to ``spl_autoload_register()``.
  Typically, this callback should utilize the map returned by ``autoload_filemap.php``.

- ``autoload_register.php`` should register a PHP callback (typically that returned by ``autoload_function.php``
  with ``spl_autoload_register()``.

The point of these three files is to provide reasonable default mechanisms for autoloading the classes contained in
the module, thus providing a trivial way to consume the module without requiring ``Zend\Module`` (e.g., for use
outside a ZF2 application).

The ``config`` directory should contain any module-specific configuration. These files may be in any format
``Zend\Config`` supports. We recommend naming the main configuration "module.format", and for PHP-based
configuration, "module.config.php". Typically, you will create configuration for the router as well as for the
dependency injector.

The ``src`` directory should be a `PSR-0 compliant directory structure`_ with your module's source code. Typically,
you should at least have one subdirectory named after your module namespace; however, you can ship code from
multiple namespaces if desired.

The ``test`` directory should contain your unit tests. Typically, these will be written using `PHPUnit`_, and
contain artifacts related to its configuration (e.g., ``phpunit.xml``, ``bootstrap.php``).

The ``public`` directory can be used for assets that you may want to expose in your application's document root.
These might include images, CSS files, JavaScript files, etc. How these are exposed is left to the developer.

The ``view`` directory contains view scripts related to your controllers.

.. _zend.mvc.intro.bootstrapping-an-application:

Bootstrapping an Application
----------------------------

The ``Application`` has six basic dependencies.

- **configuration**, usually an array or object implementing ``ArrayAccess``.

- **ServiceManager** instance.

- **EventManager** instance, which, by default, is pulled from the ``ServiceManager``, by the service name
  "EventManager".

- **ModuleManager** instance, which, by default, is pulled from the ``ServiceManager``, by the service name
  "ModuleManager".

- **Request** instance, which, by default, is pulled from the ``ServiceManager``, by the service name "Request".

- **Response** instance, which, by default, is pulled from the ``ServiceManager``, by the service name "Response".

These may be satisfied at instantiation:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   use Zend\EventManager\EventManager;
   use Zend\Http\PhpEnvironment;
   use Zend\ModuleManager\ModuleManager;
   use Zend\Mvc\Application;
   use Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceManager;

   $config = include 'config/application.php';

   $serviceManager = new ServiceManager();
   $serviceManager->setService('EventManager', new EventManager());
   $serviceManager->setService('ModuleManager', new ModuleManager());
   $serviceManager->setService('Request', new PhpEnvironment\Request());
   $serviceManager->setService('Response', new PhpEnvironment\Response());

   $application = new Application($config, $serviceManager);

Once you've done this, there are two additional actions you can take. The first is to "bootstrap" the application.
In the default implementation, this does the following:

- Attaches the default route listener (``Zend\Mvc\RouteListener``).

- Attaches the default dispatch listener (``Zend\Mvc\DispatchListener``).

- Attaches the ``ViewManager`` listener (``Zend\Mvc\View\ViewManager``).

- Creates the ``MvcEvent``, and injects it with the application, request, and response; it also retrieves the
  router (``Zend\Mvc\Router\Http\TreeRouteStack``) at this time and attaches it to the event.

- Triggers the "bootstrap" event.

If you do not want these actions, or want to provide alternatives, you can do so by extending the ``Application``
class and/or simply coding what actions you want to occur.

The second action you can take with the configured ``Application`` is to ``run()`` it. Calling this method simply
does the following: it triggers the "route" event, followed by the "dispatch" event, and, depending on execution,
the "render" event; when done, it triggers the "finish" event, and then returns the response instance. If an error
occurs during either the "route" or "dispatch" event, a "dispatch.error" event is triggered as well.

This is a lot to remember in order to bootstrap the application; in fact, we haven't covered all the services
available by default yet. You can greatly simplify things by using the default ``ServiceManager`` configuration
shipped with the MVC.

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   use Zend\Loader\AutoloaderFactory;
   use Zend\Mvc\Service\ServiceManagerConfiguration;
   use Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceManager;

   // setup autoloader
   AutoloaderFactory::factory();

   // get application stack configuration
   $configuration = include 'config/application.config.php';

   // setup service manager
   $serviceManager = new ServiceManager(new ServiceManagerConfiguration());
   $serviceManager->setService('ApplicationConfiguration', $configuration);

   // load modules -- which will provide services, configuration, and more
   $serviceManager->get('ModuleManager')->loadModules();

   // bootstrap and run application
   $application = $serviceManager->get('Application');
   $application->bootstrap();
   $response = $application->run();
   $response->send();

You'll note that you have a great amount of control over the workflow. Using the ``ServiceManager``, you have
fine-grained control over what services are available, how they are instantiated, and what dependencies are
injected into them. Using the ``EventManager``'s priority system, you can intercept any of the application events
("bootstrap", "route", "dispatch", "dispatch.error", "render", and "finish") anywhere during execution, allowing
you to craft your own application workflows as needed.

.. _zend.mvc.intro.bootstrapping-a-modular-application:

Bootstrapping a Modular Application
-----------------------------------

While the previous approach largely works, where does the configuration come from? When we create a modular
application, the assumption will be that it's from the modules themselves. How do we get that information and
aggregate it, then?

The answer is via ``Zend\ModuleManager\ModuleManager``. This component allows you to specify where modules exist,
and it will then locate each module and initialize it. Module classes can tie into various listeners on the
``ModuleManager`` in order to provide configuration, services, listeners, and more to the application. Sound
complicated? It's not.

.. _zend.mvc.intro.bootstrapping-a-modular-application.configuring-the-module-manager:

Configuring the Module Manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first step is configuring the module manager. You simply inform the module manager which modules to load, and
potentially provide configuration for the module listeners.

Remember the ``application.php`` from earlier? We're going to provide some configuration.

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   <?php
   // config/application.php
   return array(
       'modules' => array(
           /* ... */
       ),
       'module_listener_options' => array(
           'module_paths' => array(
               './module',
               './vendor',
           ),
       ),
   );

As we add modules to the system, we'll add items to the ``modules`` array.

Each ``Module`` class that has configuration it wants the ``Application`` to know about should define a
``getConfig()`` method. That method should return an array or ``Traversable`` object such as
``Zend\Config\Config``. As an example:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   namespace ZendUser;

   class Module
   {
       public function getConfig()
       {
           return include __DIR__ . '/config/module.config.php'
       }
   }

There are a number of other methods you can define for tasks ranging from providing autoloader configuration, to
providing services to the ``ServiceManager``, to listening to the bootstrap event. The ModuleManager documentation
goes into more detail on these.

.. _zend.mvc.intro.conclusion:

Conclusion
----------

The ZF2 MVC layer is incredibly flexible, offering an opt-in, easy to create modular infrastructure, as well as the
ability to craft your own application workflows via the ``ServiceManager`` and ``EventManager``. The module manager
is a lightweight and simple approach to enforcing a modular architecture that encourages clean separation of
concerns and code re-use.
