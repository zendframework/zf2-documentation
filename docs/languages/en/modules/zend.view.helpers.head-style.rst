HeadStyle Helper
----------------

The *HTML* **<style>** element is used to include *CSS* stylesheets inline in the *HTML* **<head>** element.

.. note::

   **Use HeadLink to link CSS files**

   :ref:`HeadLink <zend.view.helpers.initial.headlink>` should be used to create **<link>** elements for including
   external stylesheets. ``HeadStyle`` is used when you wish to define your stylesheets inline.

The ``HeadStyle`` helper supports the following methods for setting and adding stylesheet declarations:

- ``appendStyle($content, $attributes = array())``

- ``offsetSetStyle($index, $content, $attributes = array())``

- ``prependStyle($content, $attributes = array())``

- ``setStyle($content, $attributes = array())``

In all cases, ``$content`` is the actual *CSS* declarations. ``$attributes`` are any additional attributes you wish
to provide to the ``style`` tag: lang, title, media, or dir are all permissible.

.. note::

   **Setting Conditional Comments**

   ``HeadStyle`` allows you to wrap the style tag in conditional comments, which allows you to hide it from
   specific browsers. To add the conditional tags, pass the conditional value as part of the ``$attributes``
   parameter in the method calls.

   .. _zend.view.helpers.initial.headstyle.conditional:

   .. rubric:: Headstyle With Conditional Comments

   .. code-block:: php
      :linenos:

      // adding scripts
      $this->headStyle()->appendStyle($styles, array('conditional' => 'lt IE 7'));

``HeadStyle`` also allows capturing style declarations; this can be useful if you want to create the declarations
programmatically, and then place them elsewhere. The usage for this will be showed in an example below.

Finally, you can also use the ``headStyle()`` method to quickly add declarations elements; the signature for this
is ``headStyle($content$placement = 'APPEND', $attributes = array())``. ``$placement`` should be either 'APPEND',
'PREPEND', or 'SET'.

``HeadStyle`` overrides each of ``append()``, ``offsetSet()``, ``prepend()``, and ``set()`` to enforce usage of the
special methods as listed above. Internally, it stores each item as a ``stdClass`` token, which it later serializes
using the ``itemToString()`` method. This allows you to perform checks on the items in the stack, and optionally
modify these items by simply modifying the object returned.

The ``HeadStyle`` helper is a concrete implementation of the :ref:`Placeholder helper
<zend.view.helpers.initial.placeholder>`.

.. note::

   **UTF-8 encoding used by default**

   By default, Zend Framework uses *UTF-8* as its default encoding, and, specific to this case, ``Zend\View`` does
   as well. Character encoding can be set differently on the view object itself using the ``setEncoding()`` method
   (or the the ``encoding`` instantiation parameter). However, since ``Zend\View\Interface`` does not define
   accessors for encoding, it's possible that if you are using a custom view implementation with this view helper,
   you will not have a ``getEncoding()`` method, which is what the view helper uses internally for determining the
   character set in which to encode.

   If you do not want to utilize *UTF-8* in such a situation, you will need to implement a ``getEncoding()`` method
   in your custom view implementation.

.. _zend.view.helpers.initial.headstyle.basicusage:

.. rubric:: HeadStyle Helper Basic Usage

You may specify a new style tag at any time:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   // adding styles
   $this->headStyle()->appendStyle($styles);

Order is very important with *CSS*; you may need to ensure that declarations are loaded in a specific order due to
the order of the cascade; use the various append, prepend, and offsetSet directives to aid in this task:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   // Putting styles in order

   // place at a particular offset:
   $this->headStyle()->offsetSetStyle(100, $customStyles);

   // place at end:
   $this->headStyle()->appendStyle($finalStyles);

   // place at beginning
   $this->headStyle()->prependStyle($firstStyles);

When you're finally ready to output all style declarations in your layout script, simply echo the helper:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   <?php echo $this->headStyle() ?>

.. _zend.view.helpers.initial.headstyle.capture:

.. rubric:: Capturing Style Declarations Using the HeadStyle Helper

Sometimes you need to generate *CSS* style declarations programmatically. While you could use string concatenation,
heredocs, and the like, often it's easier just to do so by creating the styles and sprinkling in *PHP* tags.
``HeadStyle`` lets you do just that, capturing it to the stack:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   <?php $this->headStyle()->captureStart() ?>
   body {
       background-color: <?php echo $this->bgColor ?>;
   }
   <?php $this->headStyle()->captureEnd() ?>

The following assumptions are made:

- The style declarations will be appended to the stack. If you wish for them to replace the stack or be added to
  the top, you will need to pass 'SET' or 'PREPEND', respectively, as the first argument to ``captureStart()``.

- If you wish to specify any additional attributes for the **<style>** tag, pass them in an array as the second
  argument to ``captureStart()``.
