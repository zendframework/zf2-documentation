File Filter Classes
===================

Zend Framework comes with set of classes for filtering file contents as well as performing other actions on files, such
as file renaming.

.. note::

   All of the File Filter Classes' ``filter()`` methods accept either a file path string,
   or a $_FILES array (for use with uploaded files).
