Introduction to Zend\\Paginator
===============================

``Zend\Paginator`` is a flexible component for paginating collections of data and presenting that data to users.

The primary design goals of ``Zend\Paginator`` are as follows:



   - Paginate arbitrary data, not just relational databases

   - Fetch only the results that need to be displayed

   - Do not force users to adhere to only one way of displaying data or rendering pagination controls

   - Loosely couple ``Zend\Paginator`` to other Zend Framework components so that users who wish to use it
     independently of ``Zend\View``, ``Zend\Db``, etc. can do so
