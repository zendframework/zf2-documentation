Overview

Zend Framework is an open source framework for developing web applications and services with *PHP* 5. Zend
Framework is implemented using 100% object-oriented code. The component structure of Zend Framework is somewhat
unique; each component is designed with few dependencies on other components. This loosely coupled architecture
allows developers to use components individually. We often call this a "use-at-will" design.

While they can be used separately, Zend Framework components in the standard library form a powerful and extensible
web application framework when combined. Zend Framework offers a robust, high performance *MVC* implementation, a
database abstraction that is simple to use, and a forms component that implements *HTML* form rendering,
validation, and filtering so that developers can consolidate all of these operations using one easy-to-use, object
oriented interface. Other components, such as ``Zend_Auth`` and ``Zend\Permissions\Acl``, provide user authentication and
authorization against all common credential stores. Still others implement client libraries to simply access to the
most popular web services available. Whatever your application needs are, you're likely to find a Zend Framework
component that can be used to dramatically reduce development time with a thoroughly tested foundation.

The principal sponsor of the project 'Zend Framework' is `Zend Technologies`_, but many companies have contributed
components or significant features to the framework. Companies such as Google, Microsoft, and StrikeIron have
partnered with Zend to provide interfaces to web services and other technologies that they wish to make available
to Zend Framework developers.

Zend Framework could not deliver and support all of these features without the help of the vibrant Zend Framework
community. Community members, including contributors, make themselves available on `mailing lists`_, `IRC
channels`_, and other forums. Whatever question you have about Zend Framework, the community is always available to
address it.
