Advanced Usage
==============

.. _zend.permissions.acl.advanced.storing:

Storing ACL Data for Persistence
--------------------------------

The ``Zend\Permissions\Acl`` component was designed in such a way that it does not require any particular backend technology
such as a database or cache server for storage of the *ACL* data. Its complete *PHP* implementation enables
customized administration tools to be built upon ``Zend\Permissions\Acl\Acl`` with relative ease and flexibility. Many
situations require some form of interactive maintenance of the *ACL*, and ``Zend\Permissions\Acl\Acl`` provides methods for
setting up, and querying against, the access controls of an application.

Storage of *ACL* data is therefore left as a task for the developer, since use cases are expected to vary widely
for various situations. Because ``Zend\Permissions\Acl\Acl`` is serializable, *ACL* objects may be serialized with *PHP*'s
`serialize()`_ function, and the results may be stored anywhere the developer should desire, such as a file,
database, or caching mechanism.

.. _zend.permissions.acl.advanced.assertions:

Writing Conditional ACL Rules with Assertions
---------------------------------------------

Sometimes a rule for allowing or denying a role access to a resource should not be absolute but dependent upon
various criteria. For example, suppose that certain access should be allowed, but only between the hours of 8:00am
and 5:00pm. Another example would be denying access because a request comes from an IP address that has been
flagged as a source of abuse. ``Zend\Permissions\Acl\Acl`` has built-in support for implementing rules based on whatever
conditions the developer needs.

``Zend\Permissions\Acl\Acl`` provides support for conditional rules with ``Zend\Permissions\Acl\Assertion\AssertionInterface``. In order to
use the rule assertion interface, a developer writes a class that implements the ``assert()`` method of the
interface:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   class CleanIPAssertion implements Zend\Permissions\Acl\Assertion\AssertionInterface
   {
       public function assert(Zend\Permissions\Acl\Acl $acl,
                              Zend\Permissions\Acl\Role\RoleInterface $role = null,
                              Zend\Permissions\Acl\Resource\ResourceInterface $resource = null,
                              $privilege = null)
       {
           return $this->_isCleanIP($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']);
       }

       protected function _isCleanIP($ip)
       {
           // ...
       }
   }

Once an assertion class is available, the developer must supply an instance of the assertion class when assigning
conditional rules. A rule that is created with an assertion only applies when the assertion method returns
``TRUE``.

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   use Zend\Permissions\Acl\Acl;

   $acl = new Acl();
   $acl->allow(null, null, null, new CleanIPAssertion());

The above code creates a conditional allow rule that allows access to all privileges on everything by everyone,
except when the requesting IP is "blacklisted." If a request comes in from an IP that is not considered "clean,"
then the allow rule does not apply. Since the rule applies to all roles, all resources, and all privileges, an
"unclean" IP would result in a denial of access. This is a special case, however, and it should be understood that
in all other cases (i.e., where a specific role, resource, or privilege is specified for the rule), a failed
assertion results in the rule not applying, and other rules would be used to determine whether access is allowed or
denied.

The ``assert()`` method of an assertion object is passed the *ACL*, role, resource, and privilege to which the
authorization query (i.e., ``isAllowed()``) applies, in order to provide a context for the assertion class to
determine its conditions where needed.
