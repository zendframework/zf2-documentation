AggregateHydrator
=================

``Zend\Stdlib\Hydrator\Aggregate\AggregateHydrator`` is an implementation of
``Zend\Stdlib\Hydrator\HydratorInterface`` that composes multiple hydrators
via event listeners.

You typically want to use an aggregate hydrator when you want to hydrate or
extract data from complex objects that implement multiple interfaces, and therefore
need multiple hydrators to handle that in subsequent steps.

.. _zend.stdlib.aggregate.hydrator.installation-requirements:

Installation requirements
-------------------------

The ``AggregateHydrator`` is based on the ``Zend\EventManager`` component, so be
sure to have it installed before getting started:

.. code-block:: bash

   php composer.phar require zendframework/zend-eventmanager:2.*

.. _zend.stdlib.aggregate.hydrator.basic-usage:

Basic usage
-----------

A simple use case may be hydrating a ``BlogPost`` object, which contains data for
the user that created it, the time it was created, the current publishing status, etc:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   use Zend\Stdlib\Hydrator\Aggregate\AggregateHydrator;

   $hydrator = new AggregateHydrator();

   // attach the various hydrators capable of handling simpler interfaces
   $hydrator->add(new My\BlogPostHydrator());
   $hydrator->add(new My\UserAwareObjectHydrator());
   $hydrator->add(new My\TimestampedObjectHydrator());
   $hydrator->add(new My\PublishableObjectHydrator());
   // ...

   // Now retrieve the BlogPost object
   // ...

   // you can now extract complex data from a blogpost
   $data = $hydrator->extract($blogPost);

   // or you can fill the object with complex data
   $blogPost = $hydrator->hydrate($data, $blogPost);

.. note::

   **Hydrator priorities**

   ``AggregateHydrator::add`` has a second optional argument ``$priority``.
   If you have two or more hydrators that conflict with each other for same data
   keys, you may decide which one has to be executed first or last by passing a
   higher or lower integer priority to the second argument of ``AggregateHydrator::add``

In order to work with this logic, each of the hydrators that are attached should
just ignore any unknown object type passed in, such as in following example:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   namespace My;

   use Zend\Stdlib\Hydrator\HydratorInterface

   class BlogPostHydrator implements HydratorInterface
   {
       public function hydrate($data, $object)
       {
           if (!$object instanceof BlogPost) {
               return $object;
           }

           // ... continue hydration ...
       }

       public function extract($object)
       {
           if (!$object instanceof BlogPost) {
               return array();
           }

           // ... continue extraction ...
       }
   }

.. _zend.stdlib.aggregate.hydrator.advanced-use-cases:

Advanced use cases
------------------

Since the ``AggregateHydrator`` is event-driven, you can use the ``EventManager``
API to tweak its behaviour.

Common use cases are:

 * Removal of hydrated data keys (passwords/confidential information) depending on
   business rules
 * Caching of the hydration/extraction process
 * Transformations on extracted data, for compatibility with third-party APIs

In the following example, a cache listener will be introduced to speed up hydration,
which can be very useful when the same data is requested multiple times:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   use Zend\Stdlib\Hydrator\Aggregate\AggregateHydrator;
   use Zend\Stdlib\Hydrator\Aggregate\ExtractEvent;
   use Zend\Cache\Storage\Adapter\Memory;

   $hydrator = new AggregateHydrator();

   // attach the various hydrators
   $hydrator->add(new My\BlogPostHydrator());
   $hydrator->add(new My\UserAwareObjectHydrator());
   $hydrator->add(new My\TimestampedObjectHydrator());
   $hydrator->add(new My\PublishableObjectHydrator());
   // ...

   $cache             = new Memory();
   $cacheReadListener = function (ExtractEvent $event) use ($cache) {
       $object = $event->getExtractionObject();

       if (!$object instanceof BlogPost) {
           return;
       }

       if ($cache->hasItem($object->getId())) {
           $event->setExtractedData($cache->getItem($object->getId()));
           $event->stopPropagation();
       }
   };
   $cacheWriteListener = function (ExtractEvent $event) use ($cache) {
       $object = $event->getExtractionObject();

       if (!$object instanceof BlogPost) {
           return;
       }

       $cache->setItem($object->getId(), $event->getExtractedData());
   };

   // attaching a high priority listener executed before extraction logic
   $hydrator->getEventManager()->attach(ExtractEvent::EVENT_EXTRACT, $cacheReadListener, 1000);
   // attaching a low priority listener executed after extraction logic
   $hydrator->getEventManager()->attach(ExtractEvent::EVENT_EXTRACT, $cacheWriteListener, -1000);

With an aggregate hydrator configured in this way, any ``$hydrator->extract($blogPost)``
operation will be cached
