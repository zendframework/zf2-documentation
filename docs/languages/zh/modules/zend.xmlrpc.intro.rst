Introduction
============

From its `home page`_, XML-RPC is described as a "...remote procedure calling using HTTP as the transport and XML
as the encoding. XML-RPC is designed to be as simple as possible, while allowing complex data structures to be
transmitted, processed and returned."

Zend Framework provides support for both consuming remote XML-RPC services and building new XML-RPC servers.
