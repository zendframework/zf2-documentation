Introduction
============

The ``ZendPdf`` component is a *PDF* (Portable Document Format) manipulation engine. It can load, create, modify
and save documents. Thus it can help any *PHP* application dynamically create *PDF* documents by modifying existing
documents or generating new ones from scratch. ``ZendPdf`` offers the following features:



   - Create a new document or load existing one. [#]_

   - Retrieve a specified revision of the document.

   - Manipulate pages within a document. Change page order, add new pages, remove pages from a document.

   - Different drawing primitives (lines, rectangles, polygons, circles, ellipses and sectors).

   - Text drawing using any of the 14 standard (built-in) fonts or your own custom TrueType fonts.

   - Rotations.

   - Image drawing. [#]_

   - Incremental *PDF* file update.
