Introduction to Zend\\Barcode
=============================

``Zend\Barcode\Barcode`` provides a generic way to generate barcodes. The ``Zend\Barcode`` component is divided
into two subcomponents: barcode objects and renderers. Objects allow you to create barcodes independently of the
renderer. Renderer allow you to draw barcodes based on the support required.
