Introduction
============

From its `home page`_, *XML-RPC* is described as a "...remote procedure calling using *HTTP* as the transport and
*XML* as the encoding. *XML-RPC* is designed to be as simple as possible, while allowing complex data structures to
be transmitted, processed and returned."

Zend Framework provides support for both consuming remote *XML-RPC* services and building new *XML-RPC* servers.
