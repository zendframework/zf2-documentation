Introduction
============

``Zend_Paginator`` is a flexible component for paginating collections of data and presenting that data to users.

The primary design goals of ``Zend_Paginator`` are as follows:

- Paginate arbitrary data, not just relational databases

- Fetch only the results that need to be displayed

- Do not force users to adhere to only one way of displaying data or rendering pagination controls

- Loosely couple ``Zend_Paginator`` to other Zend Framework components so that users who wish to use it independently of ``Zend_View``, ``Zend_Db``, etc. can do so
