Character Set
=============


.. _zend.search.lucene.charset.description:

UTF-8 and single-byte character set support
-------------------------------------------

``Zend_Search_Lucene`` works with the UTF-8 charset internally. Index files store unicode data in Java's "modified UTF-8 encoding". ``Zend_Search_Lucene`` core completely supports this encoding with one exception. [#]_

Actual input data encoding may be specified through ``Zend_Search_Lucene`` *API*. Data will be automatically converted into UTF-8 encoding.


.. _zend.search.lucene.charset.default_analyzer:

Default text analyzer
---------------------

However, the default text analyzer (which is also used within query parser) uses ctype_alpha() for tokenizing text and queries.

ctype_alpha() is not UTF-8 compatible, so the analyzer converts text to 'ASCII//TRANSLIT' encoding before indexing. The same processing is transparently performed during query parsing. [#]_

.. note::
   Default analyzer doesn't treats numbers as parts of terms. Use corresponding 'Num' analyzer if you don't want words to be broken by numbers.



.. _zend.search.lucene.charset.utf_analyzer:

UTF-8 compatible text analyzers
-------------------------------

``Zend_Search_Lucene`` also contains a set of UTF-8 compatible analyzers: ``Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer_Common_Utf8``, ``Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer_Common_Utf8Num``, ``Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer_Common_Utf8_CaseInsensitive``, ``Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer_Common_Utf8Num_CaseInsensitive``.

Any of this analyzers can be enabled with the code like this:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer::setDefault(
       new Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer_Common_Utf8());

.. warning::
   UTF-8 compatible analyzers were improved in Zend Framework 1.5. Early versions of analyzers assumed all non-ascii characters are letters. New analyzers implementation has more accurate behavior.


   This may need you to re-build index to have data and search queries tokenized in the same way, otherwise search engine may return wrong result sets.


All of these analyzers need PCRE (Perl-compatible regular expressions) library to be compiled with UTF-8 support turned on. PCRE UTF-8 support is turned on for the PCRE library sources bundled with *PHP* source code distribution, but if shared library is used instead of bundled with *PHP* sources, then UTF-8 support state may depend on you operating system.

Use the following code to check, if PCRE UTF-8 support is enabled:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   if (@preg_match('/\pL/u', 'a') == 1) {
       echo "PCRE unicode support is turned on.\n";
   } else {
       echo "PCRE unicode support is turned off.\n";
   }

Case insensitive versions of UTF-8 compatible analyzers also need `mbstring`_ extension to be enabled.

If you don't want mbstring extension to be turned on, but need case insensitive search, you may use the following approach: normalize source data before indexing and query string before searching by converting them to lowercase:

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   // Indexing
   setlocale(LC_CTYPE, 'de_DE.iso-8859-1');

   ...

   Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer::setDefault(
       new Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer_Common_Utf8());

   ...

   $doc = new Zend_Search_Lucene_Document();

   $doc->addField(Zend_Search_Lucene_Field::UnStored('contents',
                                                     strtolower($contents)));

   // Title field for search through (indexed, unstored)
   $doc->addField(Zend_Search_Lucene_Field::UnStored('title',
                                                     strtolower($title)));

   // Title field for retrieving (unindexed, stored)
   $doc->addField(Zend_Search_Lucene_Field::UnIndexed('_title', $title));

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

   // Searching
   setlocale(LC_CTYPE, 'de_DE.iso-8859-1');

   ...

   Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer::setDefault(
       new Zend_Search_Lucene_Analysis_Analyzer_Common_Utf8());

   ...

   $hits = $index->find(strtolower($query));



.. _`mbstring`: http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mbstring.php

.. [#] ``Zend_Search_Lucene`` supports only Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) characters (from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF) and doesn't support "supplementary characters" (characters whose code points are greater than 0xFFFF)


       Java 2 represents these characters as a pair of char (16-bit) values, the first from the high-surrogates range (0xD800-0xDBFF), the second from the low-surrogates range (0xDC00-0xDFFF). Then they are encoded as usual UTF-8 characters in six bytes. Standard UTF-8 representation uses four bytes for supplementary characters.
.. [#] Conversion to 'ASCII//TRANSLIT' may depend on current locale and OS.
