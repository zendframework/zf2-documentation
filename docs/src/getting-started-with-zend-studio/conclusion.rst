Conclusion
==========

This concludes our brief look at building a simple, but fully functional, Zend
Framework 2 application using Zend Studio 10 with the code running on Zend
Server 6. It barely scratches the surface of the power and flexibility of Zend
Framework and we recommend reading the `manual <http://framework.zend.com/manual>`_
for more information. Similarly, the combination of Zend Studio and Zend Server
makes for a very powerful system for writing, debugging and deploying PHP
applications. The
`Zend Studio manual <http://files.zend.com/help/Zend-Studio-10/zend-studio.htm>`_
is very helpful for getting the most out of this tool.
