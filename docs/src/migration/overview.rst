Migration from Zend Framework 1
===============================

This guide is intended to provide tools and strategies for migrating from Zend
Framework 1 to Zend Framework 2. There is no single solution that will work for
every project, nor any tools to automate the process.

In this guide, we will cover the following:

* Tools for namespacing your code.
* Tools for consuming Zend Framework 2 within your Zend Framework 1 application.
* Strategies for running Zend Framework 2 and Zend Framework 1 in parallel.
* Strategies for making your code easier to migrate, focussing primarily on
  clean separation of your domain logic and the MVC layer.
* Strategies for migrating the MVC layer.
* Strategies for migrating your domain layer.
