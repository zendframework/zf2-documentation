Introduction
============

``ZendAmf`` provides support for Adobe's `Action Message Format`_ (*AMF*), to allow communication between Adobe's
`Flash Player`_ and *PHP*. Specifically, it provides a gateway server implementation for handling requests sent
from the Flash Player to the server and mapping these requests to object and class methods and arbitrary callbacks.

The `AMF3 specification`_ is freely available, and serves as a reference for what types of messages may be sent
between the Flash Player and server.
